Huh. OK. # CCDE Project: Current Status Summary

## Project Overview
The CCDE Study System is a comprehensive learning platform designed to facilitate efficient preparation for the Cisco Certified Design Expert (CCDE) examination. The system leverages advanced AI technologies to organize, analyze, and present complex networking concepts in a structured learning path.

## Key Components

### 1. Core Study Framework
The project follows a structured approach organized by CCDE technology domains:
- AI Infrastructure
- ACI & Data Center
- DevOps & Automation
- Cloud & Hybrid Services
- Container Networking
- Large-Scale Networks

### 2. AI-Powered Document Analysis
Several AI components have been implemented or are in progress:
- Video transcription pipeline (using Whisper)
- Transcript enhancement with NLP techniques
- Document processing for Cisco documentation
- Vector embeddings for semantic search

### 3. NLP Implementation Plan
A detailed 12-week plan for implementing advanced NLP capabilities:
- Custom NER (Named Entity Recognition) for networking terms
- Fine-tuned embedding models for technical content
- Chain-of-thought prompting for complex design questions
- Local LLM deployment with domain adaptation

### 4. Transcript Knowledge Base
An enhanced system that transforms video transcripts into a structured, searchable knowledge base with:
- Cleaning and normalization of transcripts
- Vector database integration for semantic search
- LlamaIndex integration for knowledge retrieval
- Knowledge visualization and exploration tools

### 5. Current Assets
- Multiple Cisco Live session transcripts (both .txt and .tsv formats)
- Cisco documentation PDFs (whitepapers, guides, exam materials)
- Study materials organized by technology domain
- Automation scripts for content processing

## Current Progress
The project is currently in the implementation phase of the NLP and transcript enhancement strategy. The basic transcription infrastructure is in place, and work is proceeding on advanced components like domain-specific NER, vector embeddings, and knowledge base integration.

## Technology Stack
- **Core NLP**: LlamaIndex, LangChain, SpaCy
- **Vector Databases**: Chroma, Qdrant
- **Embedding Models**: Sentence Transformers, fine-tuned domain models
- **LLMs**: Options including Mistral, LLaMA variants
- **APIs & Development**: FastAPI, PyTorch, Docker

## Next Steps
1. Complete the NLP implementation according to the 12-week plan
2. Enhance the transcript knowledge base with advanced search capabilities
3. Integrate components into a unified study system
4. Develop visualization and exploration tools
5. Create comprehensive study plans aligned with CCDE exam requirements
