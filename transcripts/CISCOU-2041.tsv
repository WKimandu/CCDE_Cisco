6360	11020	Hello everybody. Thanks for stopping by and listening to me talking about network design.
11620	15860	My name is Mark Holm. I am the exam program manager for the CCD certification here at
15860	22360	Learning and Certifications. So I talk network design all the time. That's what I do and that's
22360	29580	how I make a living in my professional career at the moment. I make sure that if you go take
29580	34140	the CCD exam, it's my job to make sure we test you the right way. But I'm not going to talk so
34140	39880	much about the DE today. I'm going to talk much more about some of the stuff you need to know to
39880	46480	be able to be a network designer. Because at the end of the day, network design is not just making
46480	52280	some drawings in Visio or other drawing programs. This is about knowing the requirements, knowing
52280	58500	your customer, knowing your organization to make sure they have or get what they need.
59920	64200	So it's not just about technical knowledge. You need other things as well. So that's what I'm going
64200	69160	to cover today. I'm going to give you an example that's going to look very simple, but it's going
69160	76760	to have two very different outcomes depending on the requirements. So quickly, there is a
76760	80820	Webex space for this. So after the session, if you registered, you should have been added to Room.
81300	85780	If not, let us know. Otherwise, feel free to ask me questions afterwards if you have
85780	88220	any follow-up questions or anything I've been saying today.
91400	95620	So let's have a look at some of the required skills that you need.
98220	105860	Because network design is not an exact science. You need to have technical knowledge and you need
105860	112100	to have experience, right? Because without the experience, it will be harder for you to design
113000	119140	well-functioning networks that are built to the purpose they are supposed to do.
120380	123800	And then you need to understand the goals of what you are trying to do.
124100	129640	So if you're working on a project, you need to understand why this project, what are the goals,
130120	133820	what do you want to achieve, your customer or your organization, what are you trying to get
133820	139460	to? Don't just blindly assume, oh, this is just a network. It won't be. There's going to be some
139460	144120	requirements. There's going to be some business behind it that needs this to make sure they are
144120	147300	fully able to utilize this network afterwards.
149580	156980	And we see this every day. Network designs that are bad, they cause problems every day.
158040	165200	So essentially, you spend a lot of time and money fixing those problems. Those money would have been
165200	171760	much better spent making a proper design at the beginning of the project. But the thing here,
172460	178560	and this is bullet number four here, is very important. There is no one size fits all. That
178560	179560	doesn't exist. There is no one size fits all. There is no one size fits all. There is no one size fits all.
179560	184820	So when we talk about Cisco validated designs, they are very good. They are validated,
185000	190680	of course, hence their name. But at the end of the day, they should be seen as a starting point.
190760	196900	You need to trust and verify. Make sure it actually fits. Because there might be or likely
196900	204180	will be a requirement somewhere in this information you get from your customer that says, we can't use
204180	208580	the solution as it is. We need to make some adjustments. And there's always going to be
208580	209220	some tradeoffs somewhere.
210220	217000	You can't build the coolest network ever built because the customer probably can't afford it.
217740	225120	You need to make sure that you find a balance between features and what's actually needed.
225280	230020	Don't just throw in a lot of features because somebody has to pay for it at the end of the day.
230600	239300	And money, it always wins. Every time. No matter what you do, if there's no money to buy what you're
239300	245460	suggesting, you won't win. It's going to be shut down. It's not going to be valid design for this
245460	251300	game. So this is why you need not a master's degree, but you need a business understanding
251860	257180	to be able to do proper network design and be a true expert in that field.
261180	268100	So you need to be able to analyze and understand what you're working with, what you're working in,
268100	272600	and who you're working for. If you don't have that understanding,
272920	276340	chances are you will be making wrong decisions somewhere along the path
276340	281900	and will fail to meet the requirements that you've been asked or tasked to do.
283900	289820	So you need to make sure that whatever you do, it supports whatever goals and strategy are set for
289820	294840	that business. Again, if you fail, they won't call you next time they need a design project.
295060	297560	You need to make sure that whatever you do,
298100	303020	is aligned with the strategy. So you need to ask questions. You need to make sure you understand
303020	311120	this. Don't assume it. Verify it by asking. And then you need to, of course, meet all the
311120	315540	requirements, but there's also going to be some constraints. It might be, oh, we can't use new
315540	322040	technologies. We can't use, hopefully nobody says that today, but we can't use VXLAN. We will only
322040	327980	use traditional VLANs. Okay? It might happen. But there might be constraints that you need
327980	332360	to add to that will completely take away everything that you have learned recently here at
332360	336680	Cisco Live. So this is a new, cool technology. This is what you should all be doing. But if a
336680	342080	customer says, we don't want that, then you have to meet that requirement by not doing it.
343720	347840	So again, it ties into that you know who you're working for. So if you're working on a new project,
348500	353020	spend a little time researching the company name, researching what they do,
353180	357620	what kind of company are you working with? Because if you do that, you might have a better
357980	362380	understanding and a good starting point in succeeding and understanding what they're doing.
365680	372420	You need, and we talk about this, I say business requirements. You also need to have deep,
372560	378640	solid technical understanding of the features, the protocols, all the technologies. You need to
378640	382960	have good knowledge of them. Because you need to know what kind of problems they can solve
382960	387000	and how they can solve them. And you only have that by having a deep technical knowledge. You can
387000	392120	just, oh, I think VLAN will be good here. You need to know why VLAN will be good. Because you need
392120	398400	to ask them why questions. So if you talk about the CCIE, which is much more about implementation,
398820	404460	so this is more how you do it. When you do a design, you have to ask why.
406600	411080	Because you don't implement, you typically in a way, you don't implement as a network designer.
411300	415120	You design the network and you hand it off to somebody else to actually do the implementation.
415860	416660	You don't
417000	422160	do everything yourself unless you're a very small organization where you might have both caps on.
424340	429340	But most importantly, you have to size it right. Don't gold plate it. Again,
429440	433620	it ties back to the requirements. If they don't have a requirement to do feature set,
434680	439900	then don't put it there because it will be over plating and it will be a waste of time and
439900	446700	resources to build in a feature they will never use or don't even want. And then lastly, this is
447000	452080	where the business stuff come in. You need to be comfortable working with topics like CapEx, OpEx,
452840	459200	TCO, total cost of ownership, return on investment. Because you need to understand, again, the money
460260	466220	is king, not technology. So you need to be able to work with these numbers and figure out what's
466220	470380	going to cost long, what's going to be OpEx, what's going to be CapEx. And you need to
470380	475900	understand this could be cost of operating and owning this network. So not only the acquiring the
475900	481200	hardware and requiring the, you know, the hours to implement it, you also need to operate it
481200	485740	until the day you have to refresh everything. So remember, everything is cyclical. It all goes back.
485900	490440	You design then you run it and at some point you're gonna go back and make a new design
490440	496800	because things change and this is also what a designer does. Understand that there is always
496800	504020	gonna be changes. One of the most important things you need to do is… Listen.
505340	505880	Figuring out When you're doing something you'rewarting –and that's not a PRO – when you're
505880	509060	set in meetings with your customer you have to listen to what they are saying
509680	516200	and also what they're not saying because it's hardly ever going to happen to you
516200	520000	that a customer is going to say exactly we want this and we want it like that
520820	525580	they don't know it's your job so what they are saying and then what they're
525580	529800	not saying listen to what's between blinds because they might not say
529800	534200	directly so you need to be able to catch oh this is what you really want you're
534200	539020	saying you wanting this but in reality you want something over here but often
539020	544360	these people that you're talking to as a network signer might be CTOs or CFOs
544360	549520	they might not know all the technical slides you need to be able to speak
549520	553600	business language and understand that they are going to express something in
553600	558600	what we need for our business and then you have to listen to them a figure out
558600	562960	and translate that into the design at the end of the day so you're going to
562960	563820	talk to a bunch of
563820	563980	people
563980	568040	relevant people, not only CTOs and things like that,
568100	569300	but you're also going to talk to network engineers.
569500	571080	You're going to talk to them, okay, so what do you need?
571220	574420	What are your pain problems today?
574520	576060	What do you struggle with today?
576500	579220	And how can you, what are your skill sets?
579480	580800	Because another thing you have to consider,
580920	582400	if you're bringing brand new technology,
582660	583600	there's also going to be training.
584620	586260	If you don't have the necessary skills
586820	588260	in the organization to run the network,
588400	591220	again, it's not relevant, it's going to be useless
591220	592260	at the end of the day.
592260	594960	So if you get to a customer that doesn't have
594960	598200	a budget for training or time for training, you lose.
599600	602060	Because if you put in new technology that requires training,
602300	605000	the staff is not skilled for it, you lost.
605620	607260	You didn't do your job as a network designer.
610860	613900	Keep everything you've gathered information, keep it there.
614060	616240	Because it might be something that's not relevant now,
616280	617600	it might become relevant down the road.
618240	620500	Or again, make sure you have it available,
620660	621760	don't throw it away and assume,
621820	622240	oh, this is not relevant.
622260	623740	I'm never going to use this piece of information.
624400	626520	Make good, you need to have good notes.
626660	630420	Taking skills probably will be a good thing to do.
631900	636140	And first of all, no preconceived notions and ideas.
636900	639020	Because if you do, you're going to have a bias towards
639020	640680	a certain solution even before you know
640680	641420	what the requirements are.
641760	644760	You need to make sure that you leave your head open,
644820	648040	a mind open to everything can happen.
648320	651540	So if you avoid those preconceived notions, that means,
652300	655660	you're open to adjust, so you might have an idea
655660	658700	of what you want to do, but then you're much more willing
658700	662100	and able to adjust and change course based on what you hear.
662820	665180	If you're going to say, it's going to be VXLan no matter what.
666440	668820	You end up saying, this is not VXLan, it's not the right fit.
670800	672940	Then again, you lost, you didn't do your job.
674580	676540	And you don't want to make assumptions,
676720	679920	so you want to talk to the people, ask them questions.
680800	681520	Never assume.
681520	685120	Never assume anything unless you've been told
685120	686260	you can assume this.
686740	688700	So never automatically assume anything.
690140	692960	And finally, the 2 a.m. in the morning test,
693200	695680	if somebody calls you, can you justify the decisions
695680	699080	you have made, right?
699840	702860	Can you at any point say, why did you choose VXLan?
702980	705340	Oh, it was because you told me this, this, this,
705420	706840	and you have this requirement, this requirement,
707420	709300	and you have the skills to support it.
710160	710600	Okay.
711520	712160	That's the right decision.
712300	714040	But if you can't, you're probably wrong.
715180	717580	Then, if you can't justify decisions, again,
717700	719500	you haven't done your job right.
722480	725020	So network designer, you will work with high-level designs.
726120	728980	So these are not going to be anything about protocol timers
728980	731960	or how you implement OSPF in the areas,
732120	734600	or if it's going to be ISIs, what kind of routing
734600	735180	protocols you use.
735380	737520	You're going to define it's going
737520	739600	to be ISIs because of the skill set you have,
739660	741360	or you're already using it in the network.
741900	744920	But you don't get to typically don't do deal
744920	746780	with all the details behind client.
746900	748500	That will be part of the low-level design
749080	752260	with an implementation engineer, such as an CCAE or CCP,
752440	754120	would actually do the actual implementation.
756340	758540	And this high-level design, it's just
758540	760540	a few of the common things you've put in there.
760640	763320	So you will describe all the design that you're proposing.
763920	766460	You will gather all the gathered information,
766460	767820	say this is what I've been told.
768300	769940	So based on this, I've been told.
770600	771500	I can meet the requirements.
771500	773940	I can meet these requirements by doing like this, and this,
773940	776180	and this, and then describe this entire solution
776180	779080	from point A to point B. And again,
779940	781820	explain why the decisions were made.
782600	784860	Because it makes it easy for the customer
784860	788520	to understand why you're doing the way you're doing.
788720	790200	Because they told you this.
790400	792020	You told me this, so I'm going to do this.
792660	793060	OK.
793260	796540	So they can say, OK, we told you to do so,
796620	797920	but actually, we were in mistake.
798340	799520	We should not have told you that,
799520	800640	because we were going to do this instead.
800640	802340	Then it doesn't fall back on you.
802440	804940	You can actually say, I made a decision
804940	808240	based on what you told me, so let's re-work the case
808240	811520	and make sure it actually goes well, and we fix the problem.
814040	815680	You might also have to do a little bit of migration
815680	819460	planning, figure out who's going to be involved,
819740	820420	and things like that.
820500	821740	So it might be high-level planning
821740	822560	you need to do as well.
823760	825980	But typically, again, this is more for the implementation
825980	828680	side, but it's going to be, depending
828680	830380	on your organization, it might be a little,
830640	832420	trade-off, or it might be a little bit more differently
832420	835120	cut between implementation and design.
836040	838560	You want to start by listing bill of materials, statement
838560	840400	of works, and other documents that you do.
841600	843180	This is, of course, important to know.
843300	845500	Let's say, OK, this is going to be what you have to order.
845620	850160	This is the amount of hours you need to invest to actually get
850160	850520	this done.
850900	853040	But that's going to be part of the high-level design as well.
853680	855240	And at the end of the day, this is
855240	856860	going to be the document you present to your customer.
857160	860440	And they sign off on that and tell, yes, now you've done.
860440	861060	Good job.
861220	863120	And now we can proceed with the actual implementation.
863460	865920	So typically, from high-level design to implementation
865920	868320	is done can be several months, maybe even years,
868940	870360	depending on the size of the project.
870680	872000	But the high-level design is going
872000	873660	to be the basis of everything that's
873660	876500	going to happen all the way down along that line
876500	879880	to make sure that, at the end of the day,
879940	881840	you have this implemented in a way that
881840	884440	is meaningful to the business that you're working with.
886140	887440	So I have a little example here.
887600	889000	It's going to be very, very simple.
890820	894560	We have a very small data center here for last core distribution,
894980	896160	very small customer.
897420	898860	So this is what they have today.
899480	901480	You get a call from the customer.
902260	903500	And they're going to talk a little about,
903620	905220	well, we need additional capacity,
905300	907020	and we want a second DC side.
907240	908800	OK, who doesn't want a second DC side?
908940	909960	There's 15 kilometers.
910160	911620	Sorry, I'm European, so I'm going to use kilometers.
912260	913780	15 kilometers between sites.
913960	915700	They will need full layer 2 mobility.
916340	918640	They need to VM or containers that
918640	920420	can move across both data centers.
920440	922380	And they have plenty of fiber options.
922720	923540	OK, cool.
925720	927440	But it doesn't help you much.
927620	929940	You know there's a few very basic requirements.
930260	931540	You need a second DC side.
931700	934200	But at the end of the day, you can't really work with this.
934380	935640	You need more information.
936520	939800	But the only thing we can use is that we want a second DC side.
940020	940560	All right.
941760	943980	OK, we're going to replicate and build a new site.
944100	944660	It's complete identical.
946180	948120	OK, next step, we have to figure out
948660	950340	how to connect these.
950440	950560	How do we connect these together?
952360	954140	And again, with the information we have,
954240	955080	it's not going to be a lot.
955240	957400	So this is where technical knowledge comes in.
957500	959320	So you might start looking a little bit
959320	962660	about all the options that are available that can solve
962660	964400	the problem you're trying to do, right?
965040	965900	What are you going to do?
965980	967140	You're going to use SDN or traditional network.
967340	969520	You're going to use BTP, EVPAN, BX LAN.
969580	971060	You're going to use some kind of WDM system
971060	972460	to connect the sites.
973700	975660	And these are just some of the examples.
975840	977920	But this is where your technical knowledge comes in.
978020	978900	And you figure out.
978900	982940	You make a short list of things that might solve the problem
982940	984660	you're trying to, you're tasked to solve.
985500	988460	At the end of the day, what is the answer?
989360	992440	All right, all the information, it depends.
993180	994800	Because the context you're putting it in
994800	995920	is what really matters.
996460	998440	So at this point, you would have to go to the customer
998440	1000400	and say, thank you for the assignment.
1002260	1004240	But let's sit down and have a cup of coffee.
1004360	1006560	And let's talk a little bit about what you actually need.
1007100	1008820	So we're going to take the first version.
1008820	1012720	Here is that you sit down, have a talk, and say, OK,
1012860	1013860	we don't have a big team.
1013960	1014680	It's a small company.
1014860	1016060	And they're always busy.
1016260	1017240	And they want to try out training.
1017720	1019360	And they want to do things simple.
1019500	1021160	They don't have, because of the skills,
1021380	1022700	they don't have everything ready.
1022860	1024700	So they don't have any automation plans.
1024880	1025980	And something that's standard.
1027420	1028460	They don't have any more.
1028600	1031440	So again, CapEx, capital expenditure.
1031700	1033940	So that means if you buy a piece of equipment,
1034060	1035040	that means it's a CapEx.
1035420	1037220	And OpEx is operational cost.
1037460	1037780	Right?
1037780	1039980	So they don't have any CapEx, so you
1039980	1042960	can't buy additional hardware, except for the new site.
1043180	1045400	But you can't buy anything for the existing site.
1045480	1047880	You can only buy for the new site.
1049840	1051520	So you chew a little bit on that.
1051660	1052140	You come back.
1052220	1056260	And then you're going to look and say, hey, simple.
1056460	1057140	They want something simple.
1058240	1060420	Do a simple layer 2 extension between the sites.
1060620	1063480	Make a port channel to avoid any spanning tree issues.
1064040	1065640	Is it ideal by today's standards?
1065920	1066960	No, probably not.
1067780	1068700	But this is what the customer wants.
1069340	1071360	They want something that's simple and one standard base.
1071420	1073940	OK, you're going to throw in a port channel with LACP
1073940	1075560	to keep track of all the links.
1076100	1077620	And you have the full layer 2 mobility.
1077840	1080840	You're checking off all the boxes with a very simple solution.
1081100	1083400	And they have the fibers available so you
1083400	1084380	can connect them as you want.
1085640	1087920	This meets the requirements of the customer.
1089700	1091620	But it's not modern.
1091960	1092940	It's not fancy.
1093080	1094660	It's not cool by today's standards.
1095220	1096060	But it works.
1096320	1097140	Gets the job done.
1097780	1098380	All right?
1099100	1100860	So let's imagine another situation.
1101100	1102440	You reset here.
1102560	1103100	We go back.
1103200	1104200	And you go over to talk to the customer.
1104320	1106960	And they say, OK, we can add some complexity
1106960	1108080	because we've got skills.
1108160	1109560	We've got good people working for us.
1110660	1113540	We want as much control of the end-to-end path as possible.
1113840	1114800	We've got some cabbage.
1114880	1116240	We can buy some new gear if we need to.
1117080	1118140	We need automation.
1118880	1121820	And we want centralized policy management if we can.
1122040	1127640	So again, preferred versus need, make sure you know those things
1127780	1131040	and say it's a strict requirement or a nice-to-have requirement.
1132240	1133120	There are differences.
1133260	1134160	So it's a preferred.
1134340	1135540	If you can add it, perfect.
1135700	1137860	If you can't, just say it's not possible.
1138680	1141620	But if it's we must have this, then you can't really
1142160	1143060	get away from not doing it.
1144080	1146480	And they need a threefold increase in our need
1146480	1148880	number of links because they know they have done their forecast.
1149060	1150220	So they think in the next 12 months,
1150300	1151540	we need even more capacity.
1152200	1153000	OK, cool.
1154720	1156440	Then let's build a spine-and-leaf architecture.
1157780	1159040	Connect the leaf to each other.
1159140	1162820	You have some WDM system in the middle to do all the links
1162820	1165800	so you can add multiple channels as the capacity needs change.
1167160	1169260	And you can add SDM controllers if you
1169260	1172340	want that automation capability or you
1172340	1174340	want centralized policy management.
1174680	1175780	You can add SDM controllers.
1176220	1178220	You can add Ansible.
1178520	1179980	You can add all those things along the way,
1180080	1182180	again, based on the requirements of the skill set
1182180	1182680	of the customer.
1182940	1183860	You can add this.
1184060	1187480	And this is really two very different
1187480	1190020	ways of solving the same problem here.
1190140	1192260	Because this can offer layer 2 mobility as well.
1193320	1198260	It offers the additional capacity just in a more modern way
1198780	1200120	because these are the requirements
1200120	1202180	that you can meet now and build something that's
1202180	1204540	much more up to them, up to today's standards.
1208520	1209380	There's only one more.
1209420	1213100	You can always find more than one way to do it.
1213780	1217380	The thing is you have to figure out which one is the best one.
1218420	1219920	And what would you recommend?
1220120	1222060	Because, of course, if there are two solutions that
1222060	1224640	would do the exact same thing in the exact same way,
1224800	1227580	make the same requirements, and meet all the same things,
1228700	1231760	then you essentially have to choose and say, OK,
1231860	1232720	I would recommend this.
1232860	1235500	Because then it's your personal, might be a personal experience,
1235560	1237600	say, this works better in this environment than this.
1238500	1242100	But then, again, you would have to document it and say,
1242220	1245420	because of personal experience, we recommend this way.
1245520	1247360	Because it works better for you.
1247380	1248720	It works better traditionally in these kinds of environments.
1250200	1252420	I mentioned before, must prefer, require,
1252560	1253540	expect, not have, need to have.
1254120	1257580	Make sure you do it because this is a change in the requirements
1257580	1258080	that you have.
1258980	1261660	And do you need to meet them, or should you need them,
1261720	1262660	or can you meet them?
1262860	1264980	It all makes sure you do it.
1265620	1267480	Now, again, go back, ask.
1268140	1270480	One single person probably won't have all your answers,
1270680	1272400	so you'll have to talk to a bunch of people.
1273080	1276560	Again, network engineers, CFOs, CTOs,
1278000	1280180	maybe even users, because if they're complaining
1280180	1283440	about issues when they connect to the application,
1283780	1285120	there might be, you need to implement some kind
1285120	1287020	of quality of service you need to add on top of it.
1287720	1289900	So talk to all the stakeholders that's there.
1290020	1291880	Make sure you get all the input, because otherwise,
1292380	1293940	you're only going to get one side of the affair.
1294080	1296740	If you only talk to the CFO, you're going to be tasked
1296740	1299600	with something that's cheap, doesn't cost a lot of money,
1299960	1302540	but it doesn't meet what the technical requirements are.
1302840	1304280	And if you only talk to the network engineers,
1304380	1305860	they're going to say, we want the latest and greatest
1305860	1306540	and coolest features.
1306540	1306540	
1306540	1306540	
1306560	1309880	But the CFO is going to say, no, we're not going to pay
1309880	1310160	for that.
1310620	1313020	So as the network designer, you are the bridge
1313020	1317460	between the business and the technology side.
1317740	1320040	You can speak both languages, or you should be able
1320040	1320920	to speak both languages.
1322220	1325160	That's what the true network design does if you work
1325160	1326440	with this in a professional way.
1326620	1327980	You can speak to both sides.
1330880	1333460	Make sure that you spend the time you need.
1334160	1335940	Don't say, oh, I'm going to scroll.
1335940	1337560	I don't have more time today, so I'm not going
1337560	1338300	to ask more questions.
1338540	1340800	I think the rest of your information I didn't get
1340800	1342520	my answers to, I'm just going to assume things.
1342740	1344580	No. Spend the time.
1345020	1347860	Spend all the time you need to make sure you get all
1347860	1349780	the information you need to build the design
1349780	1351440	in the way you're expected to.
1352920	1354820	Again, I've said this many times, but don't forget,
1355200	1357220	there's going to be expectations from the business side,
1357300	1358180	and there's going to be requirements
1358180	1361520	from the business side, not only the technical side.
1361700	1364840	So again, money wins at the end of the day.
1364880	1365640	It is king.
1369820	1371860	So when you talk about it in context with CCDE,
1372000	1374840	because I would be a fool not to talk about the CCDE
1374840	1378200	when I'm here, this is exactly what we do with the CCDE.
1378260	1379120	We test you on these skills.
1380300	1384380	We test you on the ability to speak to both the technical
1384380	1387940	side and the business side, gathering all information,
1388300	1389700	analyzing what you're working with.
1389840	1391120	That's what we test you on.
1391880	1393420	That's going to be something that you have to do
1393420	1393880	business-wise.
1395800	1397280	Why are you doing this?
1397420	1402000	It's because you want to be more agile in your future changes,
1402120	1404540	in your strategic direction in your company,
1404780	1405780	whatever it might be.
1406120	1407500	But this is what we test you on.
1407700	1411280	This is all, we will test you and give you anything
1411280	1416620	that you need, and ultimately you will build a solution
1417240	1419220	that matches this at the end of the day.
1419900	1422840	And we do this in an eight-hour marathon
1423620	1424200	as you take the exam.
1424680	1426920	I hope to see you to take the exam one day, of course,
1427040	1429440	so feel free to ask, and reach out if you do that.
1430100	1433340	But it's going to be four of these scenarios.
1433780	1436380	And then every scenario is going to be like I just talked about.
1436480	1437920	It's going to be you have a bunch of requirements.
1438200	1439540	You have an existing topology.
1440180	1442900	What can we do to make XYZ happen?
1443340	1444440	This is what we do.
1444580	1446500	And you do that for four different scenarios.
1447260	1449360	And these are not connected in any way.
1450000	1453880	So when you finish with the two-hour, you have to clear your mind, reset
1453880	1454180	your mind.
1454180	1457440	And go back and start the next scenario.
1457620	1458760	And it's going to be completely different.
1458880	1459980	It's going to be different requirements.
1460220	1461200	It's going to be a different company.
1461480	1463460	It might even be a completely different vertical
1463460	1464140	you're working with.
1465000	1468800	But for the DE, this is going to be across more verticals.
1468800	1470560	It can be enterprise, of course.
1470680	1471760	This is what we focus on.
1472440	1473860	But it can be wireless.
1474140	1475800	It can be even collaboration.
1476340	1477240	It can be routing switching.
1477440	1477980	It can be WAN.
1478300	1480760	It can be anything that you would find within an enterprise.
1482660	1484000	Then we have this little thing here.
1484000	1486680	At the end, we call the area of expertise, which
1486680	1489100	is a more specialized scenario.
1489340	1492380	Again, same concepts apply, but just focusing
1492380	1496600	on something a little more could be service provider oriented.
1496720	1498020	So if you work as a service provider,
1498120	1500600	it might be more relevant for you to take this scenario.
1500740	1503540	We have something that deals with data centers and cloud.
1504020	1506220	And we have one that works heavily on wireless.
1506420	1510200	So radio planning, all that stuff that goes with site
1510200	1512900	surveys, all the stuff that goes with a problem wireless
1512900	1513300	assignment.
1513300	1513300	
1514300	1517340	But at the end of the day, it's an eight-hour scenario-based
1517340	1517800	exam.
1519660	1521020	And it is a marathon.
1521540	1523800	But I tell you, I can guarantee you, this is worth it.
1526240	1529300	Because I know from talking to those who pass the exam,
1529560	1532280	whenever they take the CCDE and they get the CCDE badge,
1532900	1536400	the door is open to talk to CXO-level people.
1536620	1540140	You can now get talking time in front of CTOs, CFOs.
1540180	1543280	Because the industry knows the CCDE is able to sort out the data.
1543280	1543280	
1543280	1545060	We can speak business and technology.
1545180	1546740	It's not focused on technology alone.
1547580	1548480	We can speak both.
1548840	1552260	We are the gap between business and technology.
1554580	1555860	Whenever you do one of these exams,
1557000	1559340	it's going to have a lot of introductions.
1559680	1562280	So it's going to tell you what the company are, what they do,
1562480	1564180	what are their strategies, all that stuff
1564180	1567060	that you would need to be able to get a glimpse and get
1567060	1568160	an idea of what you're working with,
1568340	1570340	get a company background, topology joins.
1570680	1572340	And then you will get some ongoing correspondence.
1572340	1573340	You will get emails.
1573780	1577780	So again, imagine you're sitting in a meeting with your customer
1577780	1580180	and they tell you, this is what we want.
1580600	1582800	Oh, by the way, and then you get another email saying,
1582940	1583700	oh, we also want this.
1584060	1585500	This is no longer relevant.
1586700	1587500	This is what you get.
1588240	1591660	This is presented to you along the full two-hour scenario.
1592980	1594920	And you have to figure out, it is your job
1594920	1596480	to figure out what the relevant information is
1596480	1600120	and make the decisions with the questions you get in your exam.
1601420	1602260	And first of all,
1602340	1603760	do not fight the test.
1604620	1607340	Because if you think, oh, I know better than this.
1607460	1608700	This is much better.
1608740	1610220	I know exactly how this should work.
1610980	1612700	You're not listening to what we're
1612700	1614120	saying in all the documentation.
1615640	1618080	Because again, leave your outside knowledge
1618080	1619700	and preconceived notions at the door.
1620480	1622660	You're in a bubble for two hours or eight hours.
1622920	1623740	You live in that.
1624560	1626980	So don't fight the test by saying, I know better.
1627460	1629120	This is a sure way to fail the exam.
1629340	1630700	I can guarantee you that.
1633480	1637320	And when you do this, you become a different network
1637320	1638200	engineer than you are today.
1638400	1641380	If you add this business skill set
1641380	1642940	on top of your technical skill set,
1643860	1645440	it's going to be a completely different game.
1645740	1648240	Because you can get different kind of roles.
1648620	1652460	You can get talk time in front of CFOs, CTOs.
1653020	1654360	It's going to change your career.
1654860	1657560	Of course, if you're genuinely interested in working
1657560	1661820	with networks, if you're 100% network implementation, then this
1661820	1662800	probably is not for you.
1663560	1666620	But if you need that design, and you love network design,
1666780	1669540	and you want to do more network design, have a look at the DE.
1670500	1672260	Because you'll learn that there's more to it
1672260	1674800	than just the business side or the technology side.
1674880	1677520	There's a ton of business side you need to meet, too.
1680260	1682360	So that's pretty much what I wanted to say here.
1683840	1685760	I'll be around if you want to ask questions.
1685920	1687260	Feel free to stop by.
1687380	1689120	I'm typically around the certification lounge here.
1690780	1691800	And we have tons of data.
1691800	1693380	We have lots of different training that you can do.
1694480	1696720	So feel free to come by, ask us questions.
1696880	1699460	Ask some of my colleagues in the certification lounge
1699460	1702980	about learning paths and Cisco U, how they
1702980	1704760	can help you on your journey.
1705100	1707180	So feel free to come by and say that.
1707460	1710160	And with that said, thank you for stopping by.
1710320	1711040	Appreciate your time.
1721800	1722140	And I'll see you next time.
