## Review Plan:

1.  Start with the primary blueprint: `CCDE_v3.1_Unified_Exam_Topics_12132024_text.txt` to identify main domains and high-level topics.
2.  Cross-reference with `CCDE_v3.1_Written_And_Practical_Exam_12132024_text.txt` for exam structure and domain weighting if available.
3.  Review `CCDE_v3.1_release_notes_12132024_text.txt` to understand changes in v3.1.
4.  Examine the `Core_Technology_List` and then the `Practical_*_Technology_List` files to understand the breadth of technologies.
5.  Review the `CCDE-400-007 cert guide.pdf` (this will be a longer process, likely done in sections based on domains identified from blueprints).
6.  Inspect user-provided JSON and MD files (`topic_analysis.json`, `key-takeaways.md`, `exam_topics.json`, `ccde_study_plan.json`) for useful pre-processed information.
7.  The older `CCDEv3_UnifiedExamTopics_Sep2022_text.txt` will be used for comparison if needed.

I will begin by reading `CCDE_v3.1_Unified_Exam_Topics_12132024_text.txt` and summarizing its main sections and domains in this catalog file.
