# Phase 2: Prioritized Content Enhancement Tasks

**Date:** 2025-05-10

This document outlines the prioritized tasks for Phase 2: Content Enhancement and Standardization, based on the findings from `documentation_audit_log.md` and the overall goals for improving the CCDE & Cisco ACI Knowledge Base.

## I. Detailed Content Review & Standardization of Key Technical Documents

**Priority 1: Core Architecture and Foundational Concepts**

1.  **File:** `docs/architecture/system-architecture.md`
    *   **Task:** Perform a detailed content review for accuracy, clarity, completeness, and currency. Ensure it fully covers the system architecture for the CCDE & Cisco ACI Knowledge Base Project, incorporating any unique, valuable information that might have been in the now-deleted `CCDE & Cisco ACI Knowledge Base Project.md`.
    *   **Standardization:** Apply consistent formatting. Check for adherence to any general style guidelines (e.g., from `docs/guidelines/consistency-standards.md` or `docs/guidelines/cursor-standards.md` if applicable).
2.  **File:** `docs/concepts/ai-concepts.md`
    *   **Task:** Detailed review for accuracy, clarity, and depth. Ensure it covers essential AI concepts relevant to the project.
    *   **Standardization:** Apply consistent formatting and structure. Consider if `module_template.md` is applicable for structuring sections.
3.  **File:** `docs/concepts/aci-core-concepts.md`
    *   **Task:** Detailed review for accuracy, clarity, and depth regarding Cisco ACI core concepts.
    *   **Standardization:** Apply consistent formatting and structure.

**Priority 2: Study Materials and Guides**

4.  **File:** `docs/study-materials/ccde/CCDE_Study_Plan.md` (This was moved from the root in Phase 1, confirm its final location and content)
    *   **Task:** Review for completeness, actionable steps, and relevance. Ensure all resources mentioned are correctly linked or referenced.
    *   **Standardization:** Ensure a clear, easy-to-follow structure.
5.  **File:** `docs/study-materials/ccde/key-takeaways.md`
    *   **Task:** Review content for accuracy and ensure it concisely summarizes the most critical points. Verify and fix broken links (e.g., `../../specifications/business-requirements-analysis.md`, `../../guides/network-design-methodology.md`).
    *   **Standardization:** Consistent formatting.
6.  **File:** `docs/guides/developer-guide.md`
    *   **Task:** Review for clarity, completeness for new developers. Verify all relative links (e.g., `../architecture/system-architecture.md`, `../guidelines/project-rules.md`) post-Phase 1 restructuring.
    *   **Standardization:** Ensure a logical flow and clear sections.

**Priority 3: Supporting Technical Documents**

7.  **Files:** `docs/networking/container-networking.md`, `docs/devops/devops-automation.md`, `docs/data/document-processing.md`, `docs/data/nlp-implementation.md`, `docs/data/nlp-methods.md`, `docs/data/transcript-processing.md`
    *   **Task:** For each file, conduct a review for technical accuracy, clarity, and completeness within its specific domain.
    *   **Standardization:** Apply consistent formatting. Consider if `module_template.md` can be adapted for these technical explanations.

## II. Addressing Content Gaps and Missing Information

1.  **File:** `How_to_Transcripts.MD` (Now likely at `docs/transcripts/How_to_Transcripts.MD` or similar, confirm location)
    *   **Task:** This file was identified as empty. Populate it with clear instructions on how to generate, process, and utilize transcripts within the project context, or confirm if it is obsolete and should be removed.
2.  **Content from `REPOSITORY_STRUCTURE.md`:**
    *   **Task:** The audit noted the `data` directory was not present. If `ccde_study_materials` (now likely `docs/assets/ccde_extracted_content/` or similar) serves this purpose, ensure `REPOSITORY_STRUCTURE.md` (or its successor, e.g., a section in the main `README.md`) accurately reflects the current and intended structure for data/assets.

## III. Improving Document Navigation and Cross-Linking

1.  **File:** `docs/study-materials/index.md`
    *   **Task:** This file had malformed links. Re-evaluate its purpose. If an index for study materials is valuable, recreate it with correct, static Markdown links to the relevant documents. Otherwise, remove it.
2.  **General Cross-Linking:**
    *   **Task:** As key documents are reviewed (see Section I), identify opportunities to add relevant cross-links between documents to improve navigation and context for the reader. For example, `system-architecture.md` might link to specific ACI concepts or AI methods if they are integral.
3.  **Transcript Index:**
    *   **File:** `transcripts/TRANSCRIPTS.md`
    *   **Task:** Ensure this index is up-to-date and all links to individual transcript files are correct.

## IV. Standardization Guidelines and Templates

1.  **Review and Apply:** `docs/guidelines/project-rules.md`, `docs/guidelines/consistency-standards.md`, `docs/guidelines/cursor-standards.md`, `docs/guidelines/testing-standards.md`.
    *   **Task:** During the content review of all documents, ensure they adhere to the principles outlined in these guideline documents where applicable.
2.  **Template Usage:** `docs/templates/module_template.md`
    *   **Task:** Evaluate which documents (especially new ones or those undergoing significant revision) would benefit from adopting the structure of `module_template.md`. Apply where appropriate to enhance consistency.

## V. Workflow for Phase 2

1.  Create a new branch for Phase 2 changes (e.g., `documentation-improvements-phase2`).
2.  Address tasks in order of priority, working through Sections I-IV.
3.  Commit changes incrementally with clear messages.
4.  Once a significant set of enhancements is complete, push the branch and create a Pull Request for review and merging.

This prioritized list will be used to guide the work in step `002 audit_and_standardize_key_technical_documents()` and subsequent steps of Phase 2.
