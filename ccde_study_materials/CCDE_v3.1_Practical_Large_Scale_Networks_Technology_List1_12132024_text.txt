CCDE Practical Exam v3.1
Large-Scale Networks Technology List
Description: The following technologies are associated with the Large-Scale Networks elective of the
CCDE Practical Exam v3.1. Candidates are expected to have a deep understanding of the listed
technologies and solutions and be able to integrate them while applying design considerations as
described in the CCDE Exam Topics. Each of these technologies may appear in any delivery of the exam.
If applicable for the technology candidates must expect content that is dual-stack by nature.
Note: The technologies listed here are in addition to the technologies listed in the CCDE Core Technology
list.
