```python
# IMPORTANT: Use the following import structure for LlamaIndex v0.9.x+
# Current implementation has import errors that need correction

# For document loading
from llama_index.readers import SimpleDirectoryReader
from llama_index.core import Document

# For indexing
from llama_index.core import VectorStoreIndex, StorageContext
from llama_index.core.node_parser import SimpleNodeParser
```

Implementation notes:
- Pay attention to version compatibility between LlamaIndex and dependencies
- Use the latest LlamaIndex documentation for proper import patterns
- Update code when migrating between major versions
