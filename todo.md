- [x] Process `/home/ubuntu/upload/AI_SOURCES_INVENTORY.MD`
- [x] Process `/home/ubuntu/upload/transcript_README.md`
- [ ] All files processed and cataloged.

## Phase 2: Analyze Overall Structure and Content
- [ ] Review `file_catalog.md` to understand the scope and coverage of the documentation.
- [ ] Identify common themes, topics, and subject areas.
- [ ] Assess the organization of the information across the files. Is it logical? Is there redundancy?
- [ ] Evaluate the depth and breadth of content for a training platform.
- [ ] Check for consistency in terminology, style, and formatting (based on any standards documents found).

## Phase 3: Identify Key Strengths and Potential Gaps
- [ ] Identify well-documented areas that are strong points.
- [ ] Identify areas that seem underdeveloped, missing, or could be improved for a training platform.
- [ ] Consider the target audience (implicitly, learners for a training platform) and if the content is suitable.
- [ ] Look for practical examples, exercises, or learning aids if appropriate for training material.

## Phase 4: Synthesize Findings into Detailed Feedback
- [ ] Create a main analysis report document (e.g., `training_platform_analysis_report.md`).
- [ ] Structure the report with an introduction, methodology, catalog summary, overall analysis (structure, content), strengths, gaps/areas for improvement, and conclusion/recommendations.
- [ ] Write the content for each section of the report, drawing from the catalog and analysis notes.

## Phase 5: Report and Send Analysis to User
- [ ] Review the final report for clarity, completeness, and accuracy.
- [ ] Prepare the message to the user, summarizing the findings.
- [ ] Attach the `training_platform_analysis_report.md` and `file_catalog.md`.
- [ ] Send the message and attachments.
