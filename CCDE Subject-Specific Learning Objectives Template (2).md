## Template for Network Design

### CCDE Blueprint Topic ID: 3.2
### CCDE Blueprint Topic Name: AI network design use cases (such as machine learning, large language models, and pattern recognition)

**Specific Sub-topic (if applicable):** Network Design for Distributed LLM Training

**Overall Goal for this Topic:** The candidate should be able to design and justify robust, scalable, and high-performance network infrastructure to support distributed Large Language Model (LLM) training workloads, considering various technical and business constraints.

### Learning Objectives by Bloom's Taxonomy Level:

**Level 1: Remember**
*   **Objective 1.1:** List the primary network characteristics critical for LLM training (e.g., bandwidth, latency, lossless transport).
*   **Objective 1.2:** Identify common distributed training parallelism techniques used for LLMs (e.g., data, model, pipeline parallelism).

**Level 2: Understand**
*   **Objective 2.1:** Explain how different parallelism techniques (data, model, pipeline) for LLM training impact network traffic patterns and requirements.
*   **Objective 2.2:** Describe the role of RDMA (e.g., RoCEv2, InfiniBand) in optimizing LLM training network performance.

**Level 3: Apply**
*   **Objective 3.1:** Given a specific LLM model size and dataset, apply appropriate formulas or heuristics to estimate the required network bandwidth for training.
*   **Objective 3.2:** Choose a suitable network topology (e.g., Clos, Fat-Tree) for an LLM training cluster based on scale and performance requirements.

**Level 4: Analyze**
*   **Objective 4.1:** Analyze the trade-offs between different interconnect technologies (e.g., Ethernet vs. InfiniBand) for an LLM training fabric.
*   **Objective 4.2:** Differentiate the network requirements for LLM training versus LLM inference.

**Level 5: Evaluate**
*   **Objective 5.1:** Evaluate a proposed network design for an LLM training cluster against criteria such as scalability, resilience, cost, and ease of management.
*   **Objective 5.2:** Justify the selection of specific QoS and congestion management techniques for an LLM training network.

**Level 6: Create**
*   **Objective 6.1:** Design a high-level network architecture for a multi-rack LLM training cluster, including topology, interconnect speeds, and key protocol choices.
*   **Objective 6.2:** Develop a migration strategy for upgrading an existing data center network to support a new LLM training workload.
