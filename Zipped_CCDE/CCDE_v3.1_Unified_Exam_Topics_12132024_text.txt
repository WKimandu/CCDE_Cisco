CCDE Written (400-007) and Practical Exam v3.1
Exam Description: The following topics are general guidelines for the content likely to be included on
the CCDE Written (400-007) and Practical exam v3.1. However, other related topics may also appear on
any specific delivery of the exam. To better reflect the contents of the exam and for clarity purposes, the
guidelines below may change at any time without notice.
• The CCDE Written (400-077) exam v3.1 is a 2-hour, multiple-choice test with 90-110 questions
that focuses on core Enterprise network architectures and technologies.
• The CCDE Practical exam v3.1 is an 8-hour scenario-based exam that focuses on the core
Enterprise network architectures and technologies, as well as on your selected elective.
Both exams validate your knowledge, skills, and abilities throughout the entire network design lifecycle.
Both exams are closed book, and no outside reference materials are allowed.
Your knowledge, skills, and abilities of recommending, building, validating, optimizing, and adapting
technologies and solutions in the context of complex, high-level network designs will be tested
throughout the exam:
• Recommend technologies or solutions that align with the stated requirements.
• Justify why a given decision was made.
• Make design choices and fully design solutions that comply with the stated requirements.
• Validate existing designs to ensure they are compliant with all requirements and suggest design
changes to accommodate for changed specifications or requirements in the network.
• Perform optimizations of existing network designs to fix issues or mitigate risks.
• Build high-level implementation plans or steps.
• Recommend, build, or justify strategies.
The Written and Practical exams are designed with dual-stack in mind, so IPv4 and IPv6 should be
expected across every exam topic and technology.
