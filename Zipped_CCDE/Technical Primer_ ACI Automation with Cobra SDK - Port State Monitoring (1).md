# Technical Primer: ACI Automation with Cobra SDK - Port State Monitoring

## Introduction

This technical primer focuses on using the Cisco ACI Cobra SDK for Python to automate the retrieval and monitoring of port states across an ACI fabric. It covers fundamental concepts, implementation approaches, and advanced techniques for working with physical interfaces in ACI, structured according to Bloom's Taxonomy to facilitate comprehensive learning from basic recall to advanced solution creation.

## 1. Remember: Fundamental Concepts and Terminology

### 1.1 Cobra SDK Basics
- Cobra SDK is Cisco's Python SDK for programmatic interaction with ACI
- Provides object-oriented access to the ACI Management Information Tree (MIT)
- Requires Python environment and SDK installation
- Enables direct manipulation of ACI objects through Python code
- Represents a more programmatic approach compared to REST API calls

### 1.2 Key ACI Port-Related Objects
- **ethpmPhysIf**: Physical interface management object
- **l1PhysIf**: Layer 1 physical interface configuration
- **infraPortBlk**: Infrastructure port blocks for interface policies
- **infraHPortS**: Host port selector for interface policy groups
- **fabricNode**: Fabric node (switch) information

### 1.3 Port States in ACI
- **Administrative State (adminSt)**: Configured state (up, down)
- **Operational State (operSt)**: Actual running state (up, down)
- **Usage State (usage)**: How the port is being used (spinePC, fabricPath, etc.)
- **Discovery State (disc)**: Port discovery status
- **Link State (linkState)**: Physical link status

### 1.4 Cobra SDK Components
- **MoDirectory**: Main interface for accessing the MIT
- **LoginSession**: Handles authentication with APIC
- **QueryBuilder**: Helps construct complex queries
- **ConfigRequest**: Used for configuration changes
- **ModelImpl**: Base classes for ACI object model

## 2. Understand: Explaining Concepts and Relationships

### 2.1 ACI Object Model Hierarchy
- MIT (Management Information Tree) organizes all objects hierarchically
- Physical interfaces exist under fabric nodes in the topology
- Interface policies are defined separately from physical interfaces
- Interface policy groups associate policies with interfaces
- Interface selectors map policy groups to specific interfaces

### 2.2 Port State Management in ACI
- Administrative state controls desired configuration
- Operational state reflects actual running condition
- Discrepancies between admin and operational states indicate issues
- Port states can be affected by physical conditions, configurations, and policies
- Interface policies can override or affect port behavior

### 2.3 Cobra SDK Architecture
- Object-oriented representation of ACI objects
- Uses Python classes to model ACI object hierarchy
- Provides methods for CRUD operations on ACI objects
- Handles authentication, session management, and API communication
- Supports both query-based and direct object path access

### 2.4 Query Methods in Cobra SDK
- **Class Query**: Retrieve all objects of a specific class
- **DN Query**: Retrieve object by Distinguished Name
- **Filter Query**: Retrieve objects matching specific criteria
- **Subtree Query**: Retrieve object and its children
- **Target Query**: Retrieve specific targets within the MIT

## 3. Apply: Implementing Port State Monitoring with Cobra SDK

### 3.1 Setting Up the Cobra SDK Environment
```python
# Install Cobra SDK
# pip install cobra

# Import necessary modules
from cobra.mit.access import MoDirectory
from cobra.mit.session import LoginSession
from cobra.mit.request import ConfigRequest
from cobra.model.phys import DomP
import cobra.model.fabric as fabricModel
```

### 3.2 Establishing Connection to APIC
```python
# Define connection parameters
apic_url = "https://apic.example.com"
username = "admin"
password = "password"

# Create login session
session = LoginSession(apic_url, username, password)
moDir = MoDirectory(session)
moDir.login()
```

### 3.3 Retrieving All Fabric Nodes
```python
# Query all fabric nodes
class_query = 'node/class/fabricNode.json'
fabric_nodes = moDir.restJson(class_query)

# Process nodes
for node in fabric_nodes["imdata"]:
    node_attrs = node["fabricNode"]["attributes"]
    node_id = node_attrs["id"]
    node_name = node_attrs["name"]
    node_role = node_attrs["role"]
    print(f"Node {node_id}: {node_name} (Role: {node_role})")
```

### 3.4 Retrieving Port States for All Interfaces
```python
# Function to get all interfaces for a specific node
def get_node_interfaces(node_id):
    # Query all physical interfaces on this node
    query_url = f"/api/node/class/ethpmPhysIf.json?query-target-filter=wcard(ethpmPhysIf.dn,\"topology/pod-1/node-{node_id}/\")"
    interfaces = moDir.restJson(query_url)
    
    results = []
    for interface in interfaces["imdata"]:
        intf = interface["ethpmPhysIf"]["attributes"]
        results.append({
            "id": intf["id"],
            "admin_state": intf["adminSt"],
            "oper_state": intf["operSt"],
            "usage": intf.get("usage", ""),
            "speed": intf.get("speed", ""),
            "mtu": intf.get("mtu", "")
        })
    return results

# Get interfaces for all nodes
for node in fabric_nodes["imdata"]:
    node_id = node["fabricNode"]["attributes"]["id"]
    node_name = node["fabricNode"]["attributes"]["name"]
    
    print(f"\nInterfaces for Node {node_id} ({node_name}):")
    interfaces = get_node_interfaces(node_id)
    
    for intf in interfaces:
        print(f"  {intf['id']}: Admin={intf['admin_state']}, Oper={intf['oper_state']}, Usage={intf['usage']}, Speed={intf['speed']}")
```

### 3.5 Filtering Interfaces by State
```python
# Function to filter interfaces by state
def filter_interfaces_by_state(interfaces, admin_state=None, oper_state=None):
    filtered = interfaces
    
    if admin_state:
        filtered = [intf for intf in filtered if intf["admin_state"] == admin_state]
    
    if oper_state:
        filtered = [intf for intf in filtered if intf["oper_state"] == oper_state]
    
    return filtered

# Example: Find all interfaces that are admin up but oper down (potential issues)
for node in fabric_nodes["imdata"]:
    node_id = node["fabricNode"]["attributes"]["id"]
    node_name = node["fabricNode"]["attributes"]["name"]
    
    interfaces = get_node_interfaces(node_id)
    problem_interfaces = filter_interfaces_by_state(interfaces, admin_state="up", oper_state="down")
    
    if problem_interfaces:
        print(f"\nPotential issues on Node {node_id} ({node_name}):")
        for intf in problem_interfaces:
            print(f"  {intf['id']}: Admin=up, Oper=down")
```
