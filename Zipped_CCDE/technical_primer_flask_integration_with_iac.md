# Technical Primer: Flask Integration with Infrastructure as Code

## Introduction

As network infrastructure becomes increasingly automated through Infrastructure as Code (IaC), there's a growing need to provide simplified interfaces for non-technical users to interact with these systems. This technical primer explores how Flask, a lightweight Python web framework, can be integrated with IaC tools like Ansible and Terraform to create user-friendly interfaces for network automation, structured according to Bloom's Taxonomy to facilitate comprehensive learning.

## 1. Remember: Fundamental Concepts and Terminology

### 1.1 Infrastructure as Code Evolution
- Physical appliances: monolithic systems with slow deployment cycles
- Virtualization: separation of virtual and physical layers with faster deployment
- Containerization: further division into microservices with rapid deployment cycles
- Network automation: configuration management to keep pace with deployment speed

### 1.2 Ansible Fundamentals
- Open-source configuration management tool
- Uses YAML for playbook definition
- Agentless architecture (may require Python on endpoints)
- Procedural/imperative approach to configuration
- Executes tasks sequentially from beginning to end

### 1.3 Terraform Fundamentals
- Open-source infrastructure provisioning tool
- Uses HashiCorp Configuration Language (HCL)
- Declarative approach to configuration
- Maintains state files to track infrastructure
- Calculates and applies only the differences between desired and current state

### 1.4 Flask Framework Basics
- Lightweight Python web framework
- Minimalist design philosophy
- Easy to set up and extend
- Supports templates, routing, and request handling
- Ideal for creating simple web applications and APIs

### 1.5 Web Application Components
- Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript for user interface
- Backend: Python/Flask for processing requests
- Routes: URL patterns that map to functions
- Templates: HTML files with placeholders for dynamic content
- Static files: CSS, JavaScript, images for frontend functionality

## 2. Understand: Explaining Concepts and Relationships

### 2.1 Infrastructure as Code Workflow
- Code or configuration is created by network engineers or DevOps teams
- Configuration is uploaded to version control systems
- Pipeline orchestrators detect changes and trigger deployments
- Configurations are applied to endpoints (network devices, cloud resources)
- Changes are verified and validated

### 2.2 Ansible vs. Terraform Execution Models
- Ansible executes all tasks in sequence, even if no changes are needed
- Terraform compares desired state with current state and only applies differences
- Ansible relies on idempotence for safe re-execution
- Terraform uses state files to track resources and plan changes
- Both tools can achieve similar outcomes with different approaches

### 2.3 Flask Application Structure
- Application instance creation and configuration
- Route definitions mapping URLs to functions
- View functions that process requests and return responses
- Templates for generating HTML dynamically
- Forms for collecting user input
- Static files for styling and client-side functionality

### 2.4 Integration Points Between Flask and IaC
- Flask provides the user interface for configuration options
- User selections trigger backend Python functions
- Python functions execute Ansible playbooks or Terraform commands
- Results are captured and presented back to the user
- Error handling and validation occur at multiple levels

### 2.5 User Experience Considerations
- Technical vs. non-technical user requirements
- Simplification of complex operations
- Error prevention through input validation
- Feedback mechanisms for operation status
- Access control and permission management

## 3. Apply: Implementing Flask with Infrastructure as Code

### 3.1 Setting Up a Basic Flask Application
```python
# app.py
from flask import Flask, render_template, request, redirect, url_for

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/')
def index():
    return render_template('index.html')

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(host='0.0.0.0', port=5000, debug=True)
```

```html
<!-- templates/index.html -->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Network Automation Portal</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="{{ url_for('static', filename='css/style.css') }}">
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Network Automation Portal</h1>
    <div class="container">
        <h2>Select an operation:</h2>
        <a href="{{ url_for('terraform_page') }}" class="button">Terraform Operations</a>
        <a href="{{ url_for('ansible_page') }}" class="button">Ansible Operations</a>
    </div>
</body>
</html>
```

### 3.2 Integrating Terraform with Flask
```python
# terraform_operations.py
import subprocess
import os

def terraform_deploy(terraform_dir):
    """Deploy infrastructure using Terraform"""
    try:
        # Change to Terraform directory
        os.chdir(terraform_dir)
        
        # Initialize Terraform
        init_process = subprocess.run(
            ['terraform', 'init'],
            capture_output=True,
            text=True,
            check=True
        )
        
        # Apply Terraform configuration
        apply_process = subprocess.run(
            ['terraform', 'apply', '-auto-approve'],
            capture_output=True,
            text=True,
            check=True
        )
        
        return True, apply_process.stdout
    except subprocess.CalledProcessError as e:
        return False, f"Error: {e.stderr}"
    except Exception as e:
        return False, f"Unexpected error: {str(e)}"

def terraform_destroy(terraform_dir):
    """Destroy infrastructure using Terraform"""
    try:
        # Change to Terraform directory
        os.chdir(terraform_dir)
        
        # Destroy Terraform configuration
        destroy_process = subprocess.run(
            ['terraform', 'destroy', '-auto-approve'],
            capture_output=True,
            text=True,
            check=True
        )
        
        return True, destroy_process.stdout
    except subprocess.CalledProcessError as e:
        return False, f"Error: {e.stderr}"
    except Exception as e:
        return False, f"Unexpected error: {str(e)}"
```

```python
# Add to app.py
@app.route('/terraform')
def terraform_page():
    return render_template('terraform.html')

@app.route('/terraform/deploy', methods=['POST'])
def terraform_deploy_route():
    terraform_dir = 'terraform'  # Path to Terraform directory
    success, output = terraform_deploy(terraform_dir)
    return render_template('result.html', success=success, output=output)

@app.route('/terraform/destroy', methods=['POST'])
def terraform_destroy_route():
    terraform_dir = 'terraform'  # Path to Terraform directory
    success, output = terraform_destroy(terraform_dir)
    return render_template('result.html', success=success, output=output)
```

### 3.3 Integrating Ansible with Flask
```python
# ansible_operations.py
import subprocess
import os

def ansible_deploy(playbook_path, inventory_path):
    """Deploy configuration using Ansible"""
    try:
        # Run Ansible playbook
        process = subprocess.run(
            ['ansible-playbook', '-i', inventory_path, playbook_path],
            capture_output=True,
            text=True,
            check=True
        )
        
        return True, process.stdout
    except subprocess.CalledProcessError as e:
        return False, f"Error: {e.stderr}"
    except Exception as e:
        return False, f"Unexpected error: {str(e)}"

def ansible_undeploy(playbook_path, inventory_path):
    """Undeploy configuration using Ansible"""
    try:
        # Run Ansible playbook with extra vars to trigger removal
        process = subprocess.run(
            ['ansible-playbook', '-i', inventory_path, playbook_path, '-e', 'state=absent'],
            capture_output=True,
            text=True,
            check=True
        )
        
        return True, process.stdout
    except subprocess.CalledProcessError as e:
        return False, f"Error: {e.stderr}"
    except Exception as e:
        return False, f"Unexpected error: {str(e)}"
```

```python
# Add to app.py
@app.route('/ansible')
def ansible_page():
    return render_template('ansible.html')

@app.route('/ansible/deploy', methods=['POST'])
def ansible_deploy_route():
    playbook_path = 'ansible/create_tenant.yml'
    inventory_path = 'ansible/inventory.yml'
    success, output = ansible_deploy(playbook_path, inventory_path)
    return render_template('result.html', success=success, output=output)

    success, output = ansible_undeploy(playbook_path, inventory_path)
    return render_template('result.html', success=success, output=output)
```

### 3.4 Implementing Protective Logic
```python
# checker.py
import requests
import json

def check_tenant_exists(apic_url, username, password, tenant_name):
    """Check if a tenant exists in ACI fabric"""
    # Login to APIC
    login_url = f"{apic_url}/api/aaaLogin.json"
    login_payload = {
        "aaaUser": {
            "attributes": {
                "name": username,
                "pwd": password
            }
        }
    }
    
    try:
        response = requests.post(login_url, json=login_payload, verify=False)
        response.raise_for_status()
        
        # Extract token
        token = response.cookies.get('APIC-cookie')
        
        # Query tenant
        tenant_url = f"{apic_url}/api/node/mo/uni/tn-{tenant_name}.json"
        headers = {"Cookie": f"APIC-cookie={token}"}
        
        response = requests.get(tenant_url, headers=headers, verify=False)
        
        # Check if tenant exists
        data = response.json()
        if 'imdata' in data and len(data['imdata']) > 0:
            return True
        else:
            return False
    
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error checking tenant: {str(e)}")
        return False
```

```python

from checker import check_tenant_exists

@app.route('/terraform/deploy', methods=['POST'])
def terraform_deploy_route():
    apic_url = "https://apic.example.com"
    username = "admin"
    password = "password"
    tenant_name = "ansible2tf"
    
    # Check if tenant already exists
    if check_tenant_exists(apic_url, username, password, tenant_name):

    success, output = terraform_deploy(terraform_dir)
    return render_template('result.html', success=success, output=output)
```

### 3.5 Creating a Repetitive Task Interface
```python

def get_interface_speed(switch_ip, username, password, interface):
    """Get the current speed of a network interface"""
    # Implementation details would depend on the specific device API
    # This is a simplified example
