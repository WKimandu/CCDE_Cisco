CCDE Written & Practical Exam, Revision 3.1
Blueprint Revisions
Products and technologies are evolving faster than ever before. To keep up with the fast pace, we are introducing a
new agile process that will allow us to align our exams faster with these changes: minor revisions. Minor revisions
will provide us with the agility and speed that are necessary to adjust our programs to match industry changes and
the evolution of technologies. Minor revisions will allow us to update track details (exam blueprint, equipment list,
and software) more frequently while keeping overall changes to a minimum (up to 20%). These revisions allow us
to ensure our content stays relevant, and they minimize learning curves between revisions.
The main objective of a minor revision is to:
• Further scope out the exam blueprint by ensuring exam objectives are clear.
• Introduce new blueprint tasks to ensure exams stay relevant.
• Phase out old(er) products and/or technology solutions that are less relevant today.
• Update equipment and/or software.
Today we are revising the CCDE Written and Practical exams.
CCDE Minor Revision 3.1
The CCDE Written and Practical exams will be updating through a minor revision (changes are small and
incremental). Although the overall domains within the exam blueprint might look similar at first sight, with this
minor revision we added and removed technologies and updated the exam topics to ensure exam relevancy.
Refer to www.cisco.com/go/CertRoadmap for the list of exam topics covered in the updated CCDE Written &
Practical exams and for more information about the Cisco Certified Design Expert certification program.
Candidates can expect to be tested on the new exam material for CCDE starting November 20, 2024.
CCDE Written & Practical Exams v3.1 – Executive Summary
The new minor revision for CCDE allows us to keep the domains and topics closely aligned with the expectations of
today’s network designers and architects. The CCDE exam blueprint v3.1 introduces AI/ML from a networking
perspective along with the challenges and changes it comes with. There is also an increased focus on cloud-
managed or cloud-delivered services, which has an impact on network designs. Several new technologies were
added to the various technology lists. Note that changes are made to exam topics and the technology lists. Each is
detailed in this release note.
Below is a summary of the changes made to the CCDE Written & Practical exam topics.
