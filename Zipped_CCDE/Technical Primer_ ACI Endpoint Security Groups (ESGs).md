# Technical Primer: ACI Endpoint Security Groups (ESGs)

## Introduction

This technical primer explores Cisco ACI's Endpoint Security Groups (ESGs), an evolution of traditional Endpoint Groups (EPGs) that provides more flexible security policy definition across network boundaries. It covers fundamental concepts, implementation approaches, and advanced techniques for ESG deployment, structured according to Bloom's Taxonomy to facilitate comprehensive learning from basic recall to advanced solution creation.

## 1. Remember: Fundamental Concepts and Terminology

### 1.1 Endpoint Security Group Basics
- ESGs are an evolution of traditional Endpoint Groups (EPGs)
- ESGs allow security zones to span across multiple bridge domains and subnets
- ESGs decouple security policy from network topology
- ESGs use selectors (primarily IP-based in ACI 5.0) to classify endpoints
- ESGs require ACI 5.0+ and 4th generation or newer leaf switches

### 1.2 Key ESG Components
- **ESG Definition**: The security group container itself
- **Selectors**: Criteria for endpoint classification (IP addresses, subnets)
- **Contracts**: Define permitted traffic between ESGs
- **Inter-VRF Route Leaking**: Configuration for cross-VRF communication
- **L3Out Integration**: Configuration for external connectivity

### 1.3 ESG vs. EPG Comparison
- EPGs are bound to a single bridge domain
- ESGs can span multiple bridge domains and subnets
- EPGs use VLAN/VXLAN encapsulation for classification
- ESGs use IP address matching for classification (in ACI 5.0)
- EPGs require shared subnets for inter-VRF communication
- ESGs use explicit route leaking configuration for inter-VRF communication

### 1.4 Hardware and Software Requirements
- ACI 5.0 or later software
- 4th generation or newer Cisco Nexus leaf switches
- ESGs are not supported on 1st-3rd generation leaf switches

## 2. Understand: Explaining Concepts and Relationships

### 2.1 ESG Design Principles
- **Security Zone Definition**: ESGs represent security zones independent of network topology
- **Policy Aggregation**: ESGs simplify contract configuration by aggregating endpoints across subnets
- **Reduced Policy Scale**: Fewer contracts needed compared to equivalent EPG-based design
- **Cleaner Inter-VRF Filtering**: Explicit separation of route leaking from security policy
- **Classification Flexibility**: Ability to group endpoints based on security requirements rather than network location

### 2.2 ESG Classification Logic
- In ACI 5.0, classification is primarily based on IP address or subnet matching
- Traffic must be routed (L3) for ESG policy enforcement
- Micro-segmentation or EPG isolation required for L2 traffic enforcement
- Future releases will add more classification options (tags, VM attributes, etc.)
- Classification is defined through selectors in the ESG configuration

### 2.3 ESG Contract Enforcement
- Contracts between ESGs function similarly to EPG contracts
- Contract scope is enforced at the VRF level
- ESGs can provide and consume contracts
- ESGs can use contract inheritance through preferred groups
- ESG contracts cannot be mixed with EPG contracts (an EPG cannot consume a contract provided by an ESG)

### 2.4 Inter-VRF Route Leaking with ESGs
- ESGs introduce a cleaner model for inter-VRF communication
- Route leaking is configured explicitly rather than through shared subnets
- Configuration is centralized under "Inter-VRF Leaked Routes"
- Provides more visibility and control over which subnets are leaked between VRFs
- Supports both internal subnet leaking and external prefix leaking

## 3. Apply: Implementing ESG-Based Security Policies

### 3.1 Basic ESG Configuration Steps
1. Configure traditional networking components (VRFs, BDs, EPGs)
2. Enable micro-segmentation or isolation for L2 traffic enforcement
3. Create ESGs under the appropriate tenant
4. Define selectors to match IP addresses or subnets
5. Configure contracts between ESGs
6. Configure inter-VRF route leaking if needed
7. Configure L3Out integration if needed

### 3.2 Creating an ESG and Defining Selectors
```
Tenant > Application Profiles > Endpoint Security Groups
- Name: Web-ESG
- Description: Web servers security zone

Under Web-ESG > Selectors
- Name: Web-Selector-1
- Match Expression: IP == 10.1.1.0/24
- Name: Web-Selector-2
- Match Expression: IP == 10.2.1.0/24
```

### 3.3 Configuring Contracts Between ESGs
```
Tenant > Contracts
- Create Contract: Web-to-App
- Subjects: Web-App-Subject
- Filters: HTTP, HTTPS

Under Web-ESG
- Provided Contracts: none
- Consumed Contracts: Web-to-App

Under App-ESG
- Provided Contracts: Web-to-App
- Consumed Contracts: none
```

### 3.4 Configuring Inter-VRF Route Leaking
```
Tenant > Networking > Inter-VRF Leaked Routes
- VRF: VRF-1
- BD Subnets to Leak:
  - BD: BD-1
  - Subnet: 10.1.1.0/24
  - Leak to VRFs: VRF-2
  - Advertise Externally: No

- VRF: VRF-2
- External Prefixes to Leak:
  - Prefix: 0.0.0.0/0
  - Leak to VRFs: VRF-1
```

## 4. Analyze: Breaking Down Complex ESG Scenarios

### 4.1 ESG Design Patterns
- **Security Zone Pattern**: ESGs represent security zones (web, app, database)
- **Application Pattern**: ESGs represent application components
- **Environment Pattern**: ESGs represent deployment environments (dev, test, prod)
- **Compliance Pattern**: ESGs represent compliance zones (PCI, non-PCI)
- **Hybrid Pattern**: Combination of multiple patterns based on requirements

### 4.2 ESG Policy Optimization Analysis
- **Contract Reduction**: How ESGs reduce the number of required contracts
- **Policy Scale Impact**: How ESGs affect policy scale in the fabric
- **Hardware Resource Utilization**: TCAM and other hardware resource considerations
- **Performance Implications**: Impact on traffic forwarding and policy enforcement
- **Operational Complexity**: Management and troubleshooting considerations

### 4.3 Migration Strategies from EPGs to ESGs
- **Parallel Deployment**: Running EPGs and ESGs simultaneously during transition
- **Phased Migration**: Migrating application by application
- **Shadow Mode**: Creating ESGs that mirror existing EPG policies for testing
- **Greenfield vs. Brownfield**: Different approaches based on deployment type
- **Verification and Rollback**: Ensuring policy consistency during migration

### 4.4 Troubleshooting ESG Policy Enforcement
- **Endpoint Classification**: Verifying endpoints are correctly classified into ESGs
- **Contract Verification**: Ensuring contracts are correctly configured and applied
- **Route Leaking Validation**: Verifying inter-VRF routes are correctly leaked
- **Traffic Path Analysis**: Analyzing traffic paths for policy enforcement
- **Log and Counter Analysis**: Using logs and counters to identify policy issues
