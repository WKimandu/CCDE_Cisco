# Technical Primer: Ansible to Terraform Translation for ACI

## Introduction

As network infrastructure becomes increasingly managed through code, organizations often find themselves navigating between different Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tools. This technical primer explores the translation from Ansible to Terraform specifically for Cisco ACI environments, examining the differences between these approaches, translation methodologies, and practical implementation strategies, structured according to Bloom's Taxonomy to facilitate comprehensive learning.

## 1. Remember: Fundamental Concepts and Terminology

### 1.1 Ansible and Terraform Approaches
- **Ansible**: Procedural/imperative approach where tasks are executed sequentially
- **Terraform**: Declarative approach where desired end state is defined
- Both tools achieve infrastructure provisioning but with different methodologies
- Ansible uses YAML format while Terraform uses HashiCorp Configuration Language (HCL)

### 1.2 ACI Object Model Fundamentals
- Distinguished Names (DNs) uniquely identify objects in ACI
- Management Information Tree (MIT) organizes ACI objects hierarchically
- Object attributes define properties and configurations
- Relationships between objects establish dependencies and connections

### 1.3 Translator for ACI Application
- Purpose-built application for converting Ansible playbooks to Terraform
- Designed specifically for ACI environments, not a general-purpose translator
- Requires an APIC (or simulator) to execute the translation process
- Consists of frontend and backend Docker containers

### 1.4 Terraform State Fundamentals
- State files represent a snapshot of infrastructure at a point in time
- Maps Terraform resources to real-world infrastructure objects
- Contains resource attributes, metadata, and dependencies
- Enables Terraform to calculate differences and plan changes

### 1.5 Translation Process Components
- Ansible playbook execution with register keyword
- DN collection from task outputs
- Terraform import functionality
- Provider configuration generation
- Resource and state file creation

## 2. Understand: Explaining Concepts and Relationships

### 2.1 Ansible vs. Terraform Paradigms
- Ansible follows a procedural model where you define how to reach the desired state
- Terraform follows a declarative model where you define what the desired state should be
- Ansible executes tasks in sequence, while Terraform builds a dependency graph
- Ansible relies on idempotence for repeatability, while Terraform relies on state comparison

### 2.2 Why Migrate from Ansible to Terraform
- **State Management**: Terraform maintains a state file that tracks real-world resources
- **Hybrid Cloud Environments**: Terraform provides consistent tooling across different platforms
- **Infrastructure Visibility**: Terraform state serves as a source of truth for infrastructure
- **Change Planning**: Terraform plan shows exactly what will change before applying

### 2.3 ACI Object Model in Infrastructure as Code
- ACI objects are represented as resources in Terraform and tasks in Ansible
- Distinguished Names (DNs) serve as unique identifiers in both approaches
- ACI's hierarchical structure requires careful consideration of dependencies
- Object attributes map to resource properties in Terraform and task parameters in Ansible

### 2.4 Terraform State in ACI Context
- Maps ACI Distinguished Names to Terraform resource IDs
- Contains current attribute values for ACI objects
- Enables Terraform to detect drift between configuration and actual state
- Serves as a source of truth for ACI fabric configuration

### 2.5 Translation Process Workflow
- Ansible playbook is executed against an APIC
- Each task's output is captured using the register keyword
- Distinguished Names are extracted from task outputs
- Terraform import commands are generated for each DN
- Provider configuration, resource definitions, and state file are created

## 3. Apply: Implementing Ansible to Terraform Translation

### 3.1 Setting Up the Translation Environment
```bash
# Clone the translator repository
git clone https://github.com/example/ansible2terraform-aci.git
cd ansible2terraform-aci

# Build the Docker containers
docker-compose build

# Start the application
docker-compose up -d

# Access the web interface
echo "Access the translator at http://localhost:8080"
```

### 3.2 Preparing an Ansible Playbook for Translation
```yaml
---
# my_aci_playbook.yml
- name: Configure ACI Tenant
  hosts: apic
  gather_facts: no
  vars:
    tenant_name: "ansible2tf"
    vrf_name: "prod_vrf"
    bd_name: "web_bd"
  
  tasks:
    - name: Create tenant
      cisco.aci.aci_tenant:
        host: "{{ inventory_hostname }}"
        username: "{{ username }}"
        password: "{{ password }}"
        tenant: "{{ tenant_name }}"
        description: "Tenant created by Ansible"
        state: present
      register: tenant_result
    
    - name: Create VRF
      cisco.aci.aci_vrf:
        host: "{{ inventory_hostname }}"
        username: "{{ username }}"
        password: "{{ password }}"
        tenant: "{{ tenant_name }}"
        vrf: "{{ vrf_name }}"
        description: "VRF created by Ansible"
        state: present
      register: vrf_result
    
    - name: Create Bridge Domain
      cisco.aci.aci_bd:
        host: "{{ inventory_hostname }}"
        username: "{{ username }}"
        password: "{{ password }}"
        tenant: "{{ tenant_name }}"
        bd: "{{ bd_name }}"
        vrf: "{{ vrf_name }}"
        state: present
      register: bd_result
```

### 3.3 Manual Translation Process
```yaml
---
# ansible2terraform.yml - Include this at the end of your playbook
- name: Translate Ansible to Terraform
  hosts: localhost
  gather_facts: no
  vars:
    apic_host: "{{ hostvars['apic']['inventory_hostname'] }}"
    apic_username: "{{ hostvars['apic']['username'] }}"
    apic_password: "{{ hostvars['apic']['password'] }}"
    registered_tasks:
      - "{{ hostvars['apic']['tenant_result'] }}"
      - "{{ hostvars['apic']['vrf_result'] }}"
      - "{{ hostvars['apic']['bd_result'] }}"
  
  tasks:
    - name: Extract Distinguished Names
      set_fact:
        dns: "{{ registered_tasks | map(attribute='dns') | list | flatten }}"
    
    - name: Generate Terraform provider configuration
      template:
        src: templates/provider.tf.j2
        dest: "{{ playbook_dir }}/terraform/provider.tf"
    
    - name: Import resources to Terraform
      shell: |
        cd {{ playbook_dir }}/terraform
        terraform init
        {% for dn in dns %}
        terraform import "aci_{{ dn | regex_replace('^uni/|/.*$', '') }}.imported_{{ loop.index }}" "{{ dn }}"
        {% endfor %}
      args:
        executable: /bin/bash
```

### 3.4 Using the Translator Application
```bash
# Prepare your playbook and inventory
mkdir -p ansible_project
cp my_aci_playbook.yml ansible_project/
cp inventory.yml ansible_project/

# Zip the project for upload
cd ansible_project
zip -r ../ansible_project.zip .
cd ..

# Upload to the translator application via web interface
# Then download and extract the translated files
unzip translated_files.zip -d terraform_project
cd terraform_project

# Initialize and verify the Terraform configuration
terraform init
terraform plan
```

### 3.5 Working with Translated Terraform Files
```hcl
# Example provider.tf
terraform {
  required_providers {
    aci = {
      source = "CiscoDevNet/aci"
      version = "2.6.0"
    }
  }
}

provider "aci" {
  username = "admin"
  password = "password"
  url      = "https://apic.example.com"
  insecure = true
}

# Example resources.tf
resource "aci_tenant" "ansible2tf" {
  name        = "ansible2tf"
  description = "Tenant created by Ansible"
  annotation  = "ansible"
}

resource "aci_vrf" "prod_vrf" {
  tenant_dn   = aci_tenant.ansible2tf.id
  name        = "prod_vrf"
  description = "VRF created by Ansible"
}

resource "aci_bridge_domain" "web_bd" {
  tenant_dn   = aci_tenant.ansible2tf.id
  name        = "web_bd"
  relation_fv_rs_ctx = aci_vrf.prod_vrf.id
}
```

## 4. Analyze: Breaking Down Complex Systems

### 4.1 Translation Process Architecture
- **Frontend Container**:
  - Provides web interface for file upload
  - Handles user authentication and session management
  - Processes uploaded playbooks and inventory files
  - Delivers translated files to the user

- **Backend Container**:
  - Executes Ansible playbooks in check mode
  - Captures task outputs and extracts DNs
  - Generates Terraform import commands
  - Creates provider configuration, resource definitions, and state files

### 4.2 Distinguished Name Extraction Mechanisms
- **Register Keyword**:
  - Captures task output including DNs
  - Stores results in variables for later processing
  - Provides access to object attributes and metadata

- **Custom Filter Plugin**:
  - Parses registered task outputs
  - Extracts DNs from various output formats
  - Handles different module output structures
  - Normalizes DNs for consistent processing

### 4.3 Terraform Import Process
- **Resource Identification**:
  - Maps ACI object types to Terraform resource types
  - Generates unique resource names based on object attributes
  - Creates resource address format required by import command

- **State File Generation**:
  - Queries APIC for current object attributes
  - Populates state file with resource mappings
  - Sets resource attributes based on current values
  - Establishes relationships between resources

### 4.4 Resource Dependency Management
- **Implicit Dependencies**:
  - Derived from ACI object hierarchy
  - Represented through reference attributes in Terraform
  - Ensures proper creation order during apply

- **Explicit Dependencies**:
  - Added for resources with non-hierarchical relationships
  - Implemented using depends_on attribute
  - Ensures proper ordering for resources with logical dependencies

### 4.5 Translation Limitations and Edge Cases
- **Complex Data Structures**:
  - Lists, maps, and nested objects require special handling
  - May not translate perfectly in all cases

- **Dynamic Values and Variables**:
  - Ansible variables become hardcoded values in Terraform
  - Conditional logic requires manual adaptation

- **Custom Modules and Filters**:
  - Non-standard Ansible modules may not translate correctly
  - Custom filters require equivalent Terraform functions

- **State Synchronization**:
  - Initial import captures current state only
  - Subsequent changes require manual state updates or reimport
