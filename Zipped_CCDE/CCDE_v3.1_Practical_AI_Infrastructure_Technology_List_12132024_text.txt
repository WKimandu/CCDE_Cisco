Wow, OK. This is interesting. CCDE Practical Exam v3.1
AI Infrastructure Technology List
Description: The following technologies are associated with the AI Infrastructure elective of the CCDE
Practical Exam v3.1. Candidates are expected to have a deep understanding of the listed technologies
and solutions and be able to integrate them while applying design considerations as described in the
CCDE Exam Topics. Each of these technologies may appear in any delivery of the exam. If applicable for
the technology candidates must expect content that is dual-stack by nature.
Note: The technologies listed here are in addition to the technologies listed in the CCDE Core Technology
