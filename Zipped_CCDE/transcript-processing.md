# Transcript Knowledge Base Enhancement Strategy

## Overview

This document outlines a comprehensive strategy for transforming the Cisco Live session transcripts and other transcribed content into a valuable, searchable knowledge base that integrates with our CCDE study system. Rather than treating transcripts as static text files, we'll implement several enhancements to make them more accessible, structured, and integrated with our broader learning framework.

## Current Transcript Assets

The `/transcripts` directory contains:
- Cisco Live session transcripts (BRKDCN-2673, BRKDCN-3615, etc.)
- Both raw text (`.txt`) and timestamped versions (`.tsv`)
- Key takeaways and summary documents
- Some structured content (CCDE_Key_takeaways.md)

## Integration with Existing Transcription Workflow

Our current transcription workflow uses OpenAI's Whisper to convert video to text:

1. **Video Acquisition**: Cisco Live session recordings (.mp4)
2. **Transcription Processing**: Using either:
   - The Python wrapper script (`whisper_transcribe.py`) 
   - Direct Whisper CLI for more control and higher accuracy
3. **Output Generation**: Production of both `.txt` (full text) and `.tsv` (timestamped) files
4. **Index Maintenance**: Automated updating of `TRANSCRIPTS.md` catalog

This enhancement strategy builds upon this existing workflow by adding post-processing steps that transform raw transcripts into a structured knowledge base.

## Integration with Advanced NLP Methods

To further enhance our transcript processing pipeline, we've developed a comprehensive strategy for implementing advanced NLP techniques. This includes domain-specific Named Entity Recognition (NER), fine-tuning of embedding models, and integration with local LLMs.

See the detailed implementation guide in [`ADVANCED_NLP_METHODS.md`](./ADVANCED_NLP_METHODS.md) for:

- Domain-specific NER using SpaCy with custom networking entities
- Hugging Face models for embeddings and code generation
- Chain-of-Thought prompt engineering for network design problems
- Local LLM deployment with domain-specific fine-tuning

These advanced methods will be integrated with the existing transcript processing pipeline to create a more intelligent and context-aware knowledge system.

## Enhancement Strategy

### 1. Transcript Processing Pipeline

We'll implement a multi-stage processing pipeline for each transcript:

1. **Initial Cleaning and Normalization**
   - Remove filler words, repeated phrases, and verbal artifacts
   - Fix transcription errors with term correction mappings
   - Standardize technical terminology (e.g., "ACI" vs "a-c-i" vs "A.C.I.")

2. **Structural Enhancement**
   - Add section headers based on content transitions
   - Extract and highlight key points
   - Format code examples and technical references
   - Add paragraph breaks for improved readability

3. **Content Enrichment**
   - Add links to referenced documentation
   - Insert definitions for technical terms
   - Create cross-references to related content
   - Annotate with presenter information and context

4. **Metadata Extraction**
   - Generate topic tags based on content analysis
   - Create a summary abstract for each transcript
   - Extract mentioned products, technologies, and techniques
   - Identify mentioned use cases and implementation examples

### 2. Vector Database Integration

To make the transcripts truly searchable and AI-ready:

1. **Chunking Strategy**
   - Split each transcript into meaningful chunks (context-aware paragraphs)
   - Maintain context with overlapping boundaries
   - Create hierarchical chunks (sections, paragraphs, key points)

2. **Embedding Generation**
   - Generate embeddings for each chunk using domain-adapted models
   - Create separate embedding spaces for different knowledge categories
   - Implement batched processing for efficiency

3. **Vector Storage**
   - Store embeddings in a vector database (Chroma, Qdrant, or Pinecone)
   - Maintain metadata associations for each chunk
   - Implement incremental updates without full reprocessing

4. **Query Optimization**
   - Create custom retrieval strategies for technical content
   - Implement hybrid search (semantic + keyword)
   - Build query templates for common CCDE-related questions

### 3. LlamaIndex Integration

Leverage LlamaIndex for advanced knowledge retrieval:

1. **Index Construction**
   - Build dedicated indexes for transcript content
   - Create integrated indexes across all study materials
   - Implement hierarchical indexing (session > topic > detail)

2. **Query Engines**
   - Develop specialized query engines for technical procedures, concepts, and examples
   - Implement sub-query decomposition for complex CCDE questions
   - Build response synthesizers that combine information from multiple sources

3. **LangChain Integration**
   - Create agents that can traverse transcript knowledge alongside documentation
   - Implement tool-use chains for specific study tasks
   - Build chains for transformation between formats (transcript to study notes)

### 4. Knowledge Visualization

Create visual navigation for the transcript knowledge:

1. **Interactive Transcript Explorer**
   - Build a simple web interface for browsing enhanced transcripts
   - Include jump-to-section navigation
   - Implement term highlighting and definition popups

2. **Knowledge Graph Visualization**
   - Generate concept maps from transcript content
   - Visualize relationships between topics across sessions
   - Create interactive explorations of technology domains

3. **Study Path Integration**
   - Connect transcript content to study paths and learning objectives
   - Generate suggested content sequences based on topics
   - Create visual progress tracking through transcript material

## Automated Pipeline Integration

To seamlessly integrate with our existing transcription workflow, we'll implement an end-to-end automated pipeline:

### 1. Extended Transcription Workflow

```
Video → Whisper Transcription → Post-Processing → Knowledge Base Integration
```

We'll extend the current `whisper_transcribe.py` script to support:

```python
python whisper_transcribe.py --videos SESSION.mp4 --output_dir transcripts --enhance
```

The `--enhance` flag triggers the post-processing pipeline after basic transcription.

### 2. Watch Folder Automation

Implement a directory watcher that automatically processes new transcripts:

```python
python kb_watcher.py --watch_dir transcripts --interval 60
```

This will monitor the transcripts directory for new `.txt` and `.tsv` files and process them automatically.

### 3. Incremental Processing

For existing transcripts, a batch processing script will handle them incrementally:

```python
python kb_process.py --input_dir transcripts --only_new --parallel 4
```

The `--only_new` flag avoids reprocessing already enhanced transcripts, respecting the current behavior where "Previously transcribed videos will be skipped if they already have both .txt and .tsv files".

### 4. Continuous Integration Hook

Set up a GitHub Actions workflow to automatically enhance new transcripts upon repository updates:

```yaml
name: Enhance Transcripts
on:
  push:
    paths:
      - 'transcripts/*.txt'
      - 'transcripts/*.tsv'
jobs:
  enhance:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Set up Python
        uses: actions/setup-python@v2
        with:
          python-version: '3.10'
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: pip install -r requirements.txt
      - name: Process new transcripts
        run: python kb_process.py --input_dir transcripts --only_new
      - name: Commit changes
        uses: EndBug/add-and-commit@v7
        with:
          message: 'Auto-enhance new transcripts'
          add: 'transcripts/* kb/*'
```

tkb = TranscriptKB()

# Get relevant transcript segments for a CCDE topic
results = tkb.query("ACI fabric design considerations for multi-site")

# Process and display results
for result in results:
    print(f"From session: {result.session_id}")
    print(f"Speaker: {result.speaker}")

```python
# Example: Finding topics mentioned in transcripts but not in study materials
gaps = tkb.analyze_coverage(study_materials_path="./study_materials")
