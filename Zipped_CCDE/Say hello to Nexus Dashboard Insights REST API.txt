 . So first of all, thank you for being with me today. Indeed, the agenda, as I was saying, introduction for you, so you can understand a little bit better about this application. How to access the APIs, documentation, authentication, what are the methods, what are the applications that you can use to access these APIs, right? A little bit of talk on what are the most common use cases, the most important use cases as well to interact with APIs. And then, it's going to be time for the demo. At the end, I'm going just to close the session. I think 45 minutes are going to fly pretty fast, so I'll get there, be starting. Introduction. So what is Nexus Dashboard Insights? First of all, it's an application. It's an application that can run on top of our Nexus Dashboard Cluster. The Nexus Dashboard Cluster is a group of different Nexus Dashboard nodes, right, that you can install, you can bring them all together. They form a Kubernetes cluster, even though you don't need to know anything about Kubernetes. That is going to be totally transparent for you, you bring up this cluster, and then you can store additional applications on top of it. We have different applications. We have applications for orchestrating your networks, like NVO, which allows you to extend your fabrics into multi-site view, multi-site architecture. we have Nexus Dashboard Fabric Controller, which is the application we use to manage NXOS fabrics. By NXOS fabric, I mean Nexus fabrics without a CI, so running the plain NXOS software. We have as well Nexus Dashboard Insights, which is the tool we define as the day-to-operation tools. Day-to-operation tools, just to let you know what the focus is this application about, start when you have your fabric up and running, when you did the initial configuration, right? You started deploying applications, you started deploying services into your fabric. At that moment, it is extremely important that those applications, those services, never have failures. You want them to be always up and running. You don't want them to get into any black holes, right? Because those applications might be generating revenue for your company. And this is the moment where day-to-operation starts. You want to make sure that any changes you apply into your fabric are not going to break it. You want to make sure that you have everything under control. The status, the operational status, the resource utilization, these kind of things, right? NDI has a lot of tools, has a lot of utilities that you can use. I like to group them into three different categories. I start with the first one, assurance. Assurance helps you. So assurance, first of all, is a set of features, a set of tools that you can use on top of NDI, and they help you understand how your fabric is doing. Like I was saying before, resource utilization, pre-change validation, meaning that you can take a configuration file, upload it to NDI, and it will tell you, okay, this is going to create a problem or no. This is going to be working just fine. We have troubleshooting tools. You know troubleshooting, you can divide troubleshooting into two main categories. Reactive troubleshooting, proactive troubleshooting. I start with the proactive, which is the preferred one, because with proactive, we can read some signals from the fabric, we can correlate them, we can match them based on the data. We can also tell the operator that we have some problems that we have some problems with the application. So we can notify the administrator, we can notify the operator and say, take a look at this, something is about to happen. You probably need to take some corrective action before your application suffers. Then, obviously, we have reactive troubleshooting. So the problem is already there. Maybe our applications are affected. We want to make sure that we find the problem, where it is, what problem we are talking about, and as well, we have to make sure that we fix it as soon as possible. So two keywords here, MTTD, mean time to detect, and MTTR, mean time to resolve. The lower both of them, the better for our revenues, because applications will not suffer that much. And finally, we have proactive advisories, still part of NDI. So you know that all our software, all our hardware get constant notifications about vulnerabilities, about field notices, about end of life notices, and about field notices. You have to keep that under control. You want to make sure that you understand if any of your devices, any of your software's platforms are affected by a vulnerability notice or a field notice, right? NDI helps you here. It takes, it keeps a list of your devices, the inventory, the entire inventory, and it matches that information with the field notices, with the vulnerability notices that we are pushing from the cloud. Every time there is a match, you will get notified. So, an introduction to NDI. I will stop now. The last thing I want to tell you about this tool, which I find it's quite important, is the fact that everything is available from a single pane of glass. So you log into Nexus Dashboard, you open the Insights application, and you have tens of different features, tens of different functionalities at your disposal. Everything in the same web UI. So, let's move on into this presentation, right? Into our focus. So, how to access the APIs? The first thing I want to remember you, or I want to tell you, is the fact that these APIs are REST APIs. So, you probably already know what a REST API is, right? You can access it over an HTTPS transport. So, they are secure. They are secure over the communication because all the communications are encrypted. You can use them with the default, with the basic HTTP methods. We have GET, we have POST, we have DELETE, right? So, all these are the basic ones if you want to read some configuration, if you want to push configuration, modify configuration, or delete the configuration as well. One of the things that I have to tell you, which is quite important, is the fact that on the Nexus Dashboard cluster, you can install multiple applications. But you don't have to be scared about doing that when it comes to the APIs, because all the applications are going to expose their APIs, and they will do it through Nexus Dashboard. So, the API Gateway will always be Nexus Dashboard. Your API queries, your authentication will always end up into the Nexus Dashboard. And based on the URI, Nexus Dashboard will decide where to route the API. So, if it has to go to the orchestrator, NDO, it will forward that API code to that specific application. NDI is the same, and DFC is the same. When you want to push some data, when you want to create some configurations for NDI, for example, as we are going to see today, as we are going to do today into the demo, you can do that. You have to use JSON payloads, right? This is, at the moment, the supported method we have to push some payloads, some data to the tool. Where can you find documentation? Well, primarily, there are two places. I already asked you, if you are using NDI, you told me no, basically, most of you. So, for you, the only option at the moment is going to be to log in into the DevNet portal, right, on the public Cisco website into the specific DevNet portal. And there you can get all the starting guides for developers, where we provide you some information on the authentication, how to authenticate, right, what tools you can use, some use cases, some examples on how to actually run the API calls. We provide information about the filtering and all these kind of things. In addition, we provide you, as well, the API reference. So you can have the full list about the APIs. You can understand what are your different options, what you can do. The second thing is that, over the Nexus Dashboard Insight application, if you move to the Help Center, you will get to this page here, right, which is our Swagger page that we make available for you. Over this page, as well, you can get all the information about all the different API calls that you have available. In addition, you can test them. So if you are logged, if you are authenticated into Nexus Dashboard, from this page, you will be able to see what are the different options and, as well, to test. So we will tell you what are the parameters that you are requested when running some API calls. You can input those fields and test and run the APIs, right, and see what is the result. So how do you authenticate over APIs? We have two methods. You can use your username and password and, as well, the login domain, because with Nexus Dashboard, you can configure Nexus Dashboard, as well, to authenticate on some external authentication servers like TACACS, like LDAP, and so on. So you have, as well, to pass this login domain. Once you do that, once you post your credentials to the login API, you will get back a token. This token is something that you have to use. It's going to be like a normal string, like a normal API token. And you have to use it over the next API calls by inserting it into your cookies. When NDI receives the next API calls, it takes a look at the cookies, it matches the token that it previously sent you, and it knows that it's you making that specific API call. So it knows your session, it knows what are your permissions, because we are able to maintain, as well, some role-based access control using this kind of authentication. What's the bad thing here? Well, I personally don't like to save my credentials for my scripts, right? It's something that is not very secure, even though I might be using some specific vaults or so on. So there is another way to authenticate over these APIs that I want to show you. And these are the API keys. Personally, I prefer this method. So API keys are something that you can create from Nexus Dashboard Insights Web UI, or even from the APIs if you authenticate the first time with username and password. The cool thing about the API keys is that you can have multiple API keys for a single user. So where does it come this nice, at least in my opinion? Well, as you can see here, I have the API keys. I define four different API keys, and I'm using each one of them for a different script. Here, what's the benefit of doing this? That if one of the scripts gets shared too much, and maybe, you know, the API key is contained into the source code by mistake or is pushed to a repository by mistake, I can simply revoke the single API key, and that will affect only that specific script. All the others will continue to work. I don't have to go into the other scripts and change the API key. So this is a nice thing, you know, in terms of security that make your code a little bit more flexible. And personally, it's the authentication method I prefer. What different interfaces do we have? What different applications can you use in order to interact? Well, all of them, basically, when we talk about HTTP REST APIs. Here, I added the most common ones. I will start from Ansible because we are, or we developed, and we are maintaining some Ansible modules to interact directly with NDI. So if you are already using Ansible in your organization, you can consider integrating your playbooks with some functionalities that are specifically done by NDI. Then we have Postman. Obviously, you know Postman is the tool you want to use when you develop, when you test the APIs. Even here, you can download the Postman collection directly from the DevNet page. So you download the JSON file, you import it into Postman, and you will have all the API calls available there to play. And finally, there is Python. You know, Python can interact with any kind of HTTP REST API because we have the libraries. We have the request library that allows us to make HTTP calls. All the demos we are going to do today are indeed using Python. I like Python because it helps me, or it allows me, to integrate with multiple platforms, with multiple modules, multiple applications. And today is going to be my goal over the next few days. I want to show you how you can call different applications, make them work all together with NDI for different use cases. So a little bit about the use cases, about the functionalities that we can offer over these APIs. These are the most common ones. I think I have three, four slides about this. Remember that all the functions that are available in NDI are available through the APIs as well. Even the web UI uses these APIs. You know, for interacting with the back ends. So these are the most important ones, at least the ones that we think are the most important. But in reality, you can do everything from the APIs. So let me start with this one, pre-change validation. I already introduced you to this a little bit ago. This is a functionality that is available at the moment for ACI Fabrics. Imagine that you have your ACI Fabric up and running. You want to push some changes. You want to make sure that those changes are available and that they are not going to affect your fabric, are not going to cause any problems, right? So how can you do that? Well, with NDI, you can push the configuration to NDI first. NDI will calculate the operational status that your fabric will reach if those configurations would have been applied. And it will tell you in advance, hey, look, you are going to create or we are going to trigger new faults here. You are going to break your communication between the different endpoints. So you have to be aware. Into this way, you can understand if it's safe to push the configuration or if it's better to take a look, fix whatever needs to be fixed, and then try once more the pre-change validation. There is one interesting session around pre-change validation. It's going to be on Wednesday. Then I have the details at the end of my presentation. So my colleague Alejandro is going to show you how you can integrate a CI-CD pipeline with NDI Ansible modules in order to make sure that every time you make a change, you are going to push to your fabrics. It's going to be first inspected. It's going to be first validated by NDI. So if you are curious about this, if you use Ansible, if you use CI-CD pipelines, I would recommend this session, which is going to be on Wednesday. The next thing are compliance requirements. So here, with compliance requirements, we can set some baselines about our fabrics. We can say to NDI, hey, NDI, make sure that this specific configuration is following a specific pattern. What could be the configuration? What could be the pattern? Well, we could make sure that some attributes in our ACI fabric, for example, are set in a specific way. Example, I have a user. I have a tenant. I want to make sure that all the subnets I define within this tenant are not flagged to be advertised to external work, right? Because that may be a development tenant, is a staging tenant. I want to make sure that I don't poison my external networks with those subnets. I can add a rule into NDI. I can add a rule into NDI. NDI will check every five minutes, every 10 minutes, every 15 minutes, depending on the window you set for the assurance analysis. And if it finds that some of the subnets are actually flagged for be advertised externally, it will create an anomaly. So it will notify you, and you can go there, see what's going on, and take some corrective actions. Even here, APIs are interesting or are important because sometimes you want to do some changes. You want to create some compliance requirements, which are highly dynamic. And you don't want every time to go there and start clicking into the web UI, adding your requirements. You want to integrate this with some automation. This is what I will show you today into our second demo. Anomalies. Another thing, right? NDI, Nexus Dashboard Insights, keeps track of everything what is going on on your fabrics. By anomaly, we consider an event, a negative event. We consider something bad which is happening on the fabric. You want to be notified as soon as possible if this is happening. But you don't want to be notified if this is happening on the fabric. So imagine that you are working into a network operation center. You might have different tools. You might have different applications running. You cannot keep all the applications open and constantly refresh the pages to see which one is incrementing the alerts, right? What you can do, you can have a general page, a summary page, that takes in input all the information from all the applications and provides you just the counter. For example, over this summary page, you might want to know only the data and the number of alerts that is currently reported by NDI. If everything is zero, that's fine. You are okay, right? If you start that some alerts, anomalies are incrementing, at this point, you want to open NDI Web UI and see in the details what is going on. You can do this with APIs. So you can export the summary of the anomalies. You can play with the anomalies because NDI allows you to assign those anomalies to someone. It allows you to acknowledge the anomalies. It allows you to know the data. It allows you to add comments. All this can be done with APIs as well. Or you could also think about exporting the anomalies to some other tools. Maybe you want to export them to Webex. You want to export them to Slack. Whatever tool you are using for messaging. As long as you have an API that you can integrate somehow, you can do this. This is the final example I want to make. Anyone here is using NDFC? Nexus Dashboard Fabric Controller? All right. So next slide. So Nexus Dashboard Fabric Controller allows you to manage NXOS fabrics. So fabrics made by Nexus switches. You can have three-tier networks, you know, with the access, aggregation, and core layer. We can talk about VXLAN, BGP, VPN fabrics. We can talk about different kinds of fabrics that are allowed on NDFC. NDI allows you to control those fabrics. But there is one requirement. You need NDFC. So your point might be, okay, I have a Nexus fabric. I'm running my VXLAN, BGP, VPN fabric. But I'm using another sort of automation for configuring the devices. I don't want to use NDFC, right? I don't want this. In that case, your option could be to initiate an instance of NDFC into fabric discovery mode. This means that NDFC will be there. The only thing it's going to do is going to read the inventory. It's going to get the inventory of your network. And then it can pass this information to NDI. Because NDI is not able to discover your network. It doesn't know how to find the switches. It doesn't know how to differentiate the different fabrics by default. It needs some tool. But if you do this, if you use Nexus dashboard fabric discovery mode, you end up into a problem. Because when you use NDI, we have to stream. The switches need to stream the telemetry to NDI itself so NDI can understand what's going on. What's going on in the fabric. If we don't have a way to configure the switches, then this is not going to work. If fabric controller is configured in the controller mode, it will push the configurations automatically. But here we are saying that we are using it into fabric discovery. So it will not be able to push a single line of configuration. You can use the APIs in this case to get the information from Nexus dashboard insight, right? And push this configuration to your switches. So even in this case, you can keep NDFC just the discovery mode. It will be just sitting there performing the inventory, noticing if you add new switches. That's it. All the configurations can be done through the APIs. And this indeed is going to be our first demo. So what I want to show you now is this specific use case. So this is the only demo where I will write some code on the fly, right? I want to show you just a few lines to explain you how you can interact with APIs. So this is the only demo where I will write some code on the fly, right? I want to show you just a few lines to explain you how you can interact with APIs. So this is the only demo where I will write some code on the fly, right? I want to show you just a few lines to explain you how you can interact with APIs. Our situation is that we have a fabric. We have a VXLAN fabric. And we have it into fabric discovery mode. So we are not able to push configurations directly from NDI to an NDFC to the fabric. So what we are going to do today, we are going to get the information from NDI via the APIs. We are going to discover the switches. We are going to read the configuration. And then using a different kind of API, using the NX API, we are going to push this configuration to the switches. All right. So let me move here. The first thing I want to do, I will jump into my switch, right? I will SSH. And I'll show you that the telemetry configuration at this time is not pushed there. So if I'll do show run telemetry, I will get an error, right? Because indeed, if I'll take a look at the features, sorry, telemetry, telemetry is disabled. So now, let me move into Visual Studio Code and let's start writing some code for this. The first thing I want to do, I want to import my variables file. Why is that? Into these files, I have my credentials. I have my API keys. Obviously, I don't want to show them to you just for security reasons. So I keep them into this file and I will just recall them when I need them. The next thing I want to do, I want to import my NDI library that I created and that is going to be available on GitHub. I will pass you all the links later on if you want to take a look, if you want to play. So what we're going to do now, we're going to do from libs, import NDI, right? And we have the library included now into our code. Now we want to create a connection to our Nexus Dashboard Insights. So let's create a new object, Nexus Dashboard Connection. We are going to use this. This is the class NDI, which is contained within the NDI file. And if we start the object, you see that it's going to ask us some parameters, like the address, the inside group. The inside group is an NDI concept. It is an object that allows us to group different fabrics, different data centers, within a common view. So we have to use this into this example. So the IP address is going to be 1050381. And the inside group is going to be my data center mill. Now I have to authenticate. How can I authenticate? Like I said before, I like to use API keys. So I will skip the credentials and I use the API key. Where is the API key? Where it's going to be in my variables and specifically, NDFC API key. So right now, if I run the code, I will have a handle, I will have a connection to NDI. But our goal is really to get the configuration. So we're going to use this. We're going to use the configuration from NDI. So if we take a look at the call, at the method that is going to allow us to get the configuration, it's going to be this one here, software telemetry. If we take a look at what are the required input information we have to pass it, it's going to be two variables. It's going to be site name and it's going to be the switch serial number. So before we actually can get the configuration, we have to acquire those two informations. Let's start. We want to check first. We want to gather all the sites from NDI. So we are going to make a different call. This time it's going to be get site groups. If I open this one, I can pass a filter. I can pass the inside group name, which I will do so I don't get too much information. Right? I'm going to use the same inside group. So now let's do this. Let's import as well pprint. So I can show you what information you get here. Let's do from pprint. Import. Import pprint. And let's pretty print the output we get here. Sites. All right. Is it working? No, it's not working because I used the wrong IP. That's why. It's 10.58.30. Okay. That's my bad. So it has all the rights to not work. Let's do it again. There we go. So let me take this up a little bit. You see we are getting a JSON file back. All right. In our case, this is going to contain all the fabrics that are within the inside group. So you see I have two fabrics. I have a VixLan fabric here. And I have a one fabric as well. So I'm happy with that. The only thing I want to keep only the names. I don't care about all the other objects. So let's make sure that our. Our variable here will contain all the sites name. We can use a list comprehension for this. So we can do for site. Let's do site name. Name right for site in. And the FC we get. We call that method again. But this time we want to make sure that we are going to read the information contained into the first element of the list. And within the assurance entities key. So I'm going to use here the zero. And I'm going to specify the assurance entities. So let's see now if this is working. No, it's not working. What did I do? Oh, sorry. I put this one into the wrong place. So that should be it. There we go. We have only the name of the two sites, right? VXLAN and one. Now we want to get the nodes. So we can use a different method which is going to give us all the nodes into those sites. And for site in sites. And the value is going to be a list of nodes. How can I get the list of nodes within the specific site? I will use another NDI API method. So it's going to be NDC getNodesBySite. Right? And the site is going to be the one I read from the previous call. So let's see if this one now is getting me the information I want. Nodes. Yes. So you see we get a lot of data. For every fabric we get information about the nodes. This information contains information. We get statistics about the modules, the name, the management API and so on. In my case, if you remember from this call, we wanted to get the switch, serial number and the switch site in order to download the configuration. So let's close this now. And let's open to for loops. So we're going to do for site in nodes. And for node in nodes site. So let's try a print and see if this is actually working fine as expected. So let's try to print the site and as well the node name. Right? So this should give me a list of... I have to use the single ones. This should give me a list of sites and devices. No. Not yet. For... What's wrong here? Hold on. What did I do? Let's try... Sorry, just a second. I got stuck here. Let's try like this. And see what we get. So we get the node. All right. So here I have to add obviously I want to use a list compression. So it's going to be node for node in. Because otherwise I will get the full list. So this is going to work now. So let's do again. Node name. And there we go. We get the list of sites. And we have all our devices that are monitored by NDI. So now instead of doing this, we want to get the configuration commands. So commands. We get finally to use that call I showed you before. So the telemetry. Software telemetry get config. I have to pass the site name. And I have to pass as well the node serial. So just to show you, for example, one output. So you can understand what we get from here. Let's try to print this. And see what we get. Okay. This is the entire configuration, the entire telemetry configuration that we have to push to the device to make sure that the device will stream the telemetry to NDI. All right. So now we have this. We want to push this configuration using another API directly to the device. So I will import another library. Which is going to be my NX API library. The first thing I want to do, I want to create a connection to the switch. So let's call it switch connection. NX API. And we're going to use the only available class. Now, what do we need here? We need the address which is contained into the node object. And specifically I want to use the node MGMTP IP. Which is the management IP of the node. And then I have to pass as well the node serial. So this is going to be the only call, the only command that I need in order to create a connection to my switch. The next thing I want to do, I want to push the configuration. So if I'll show you the push configuration method, it's asking me two things. It's asking me the commands. But if you take a look at the command, it wants the command into a specific way. It wants all the commands to be separated by a space semicolon. Something that I have to do now. And then it's going to ask me as well how it should do, what it should do in case there is a problem. Like if it has to roll back, if it has to continue, or simply stop. So now the first thing I want to do, I want to make sure that these commands here are going to follow. That specific request from the API. So in order to do this, I will join this string. All right. And here I will use the split lines. Because at the moment, the commands I get back from NDI is a multi-line string. So now what I want to do, I want to join this string using the space semicolon. But in order to convert it into a list, I have to use the split lines. So now I'm ready to push these commands. Right? And we can close this one. And we can break here too. No. That's it. Let's break here. So let's see if we are lucky. Let's see if it works. No. What is it complaining? Of course. I forgot the credentials. This is my bad. So here I have to pass the credentials, not the serial. Credentials which are contained into my variables. And device credential. Right? So that should be it. So now it's thinking a little bit. It's creating the connectivity. It's going to generate the configuration once more. And then it should be pushing it. So it didn't fail. Let's see now again. If we take a look now, the telemetry is enabled. If we try to run show run telemetry, we get the configuration. So the configuration was pushed correctly to the switch. All right. Let me show you the other two demos we have. Let's start from this design. This is an ACI design. Very easily. I don't want to get too much into the details. We have three tenants. Every tenant has its own VRF. And we have different bridge domains, different EPGs within these tenants. All right. So there is a request coming from InfoSec team. They want to make sure that all the subnets we configure in ACI are actually part of their IPAM. So they record all the subnetting information on the IPAM. And they want to make sure that we are compliant with that. How can we do this? That is interesting. Right? So we have APIs. We can actually interact with our IPAM. We can download the information from it. We can get the list of the subnets that are approved. We can use that information to create a compliance requirement in NDI. And if someone configures a bridge domain with a subnet which is not into IPAM, it's going to be notified. An anomaly is going to be created. So let me show you very quickly how this works in NDI. I'll move to the compliance section. And if I scroll down a little bit, you see that I have some rules which are not enforced. We have some red. One here is reported as violated. Indeed is one of the IPAM rules. So what can I do now? Let's check first what this rule is expecting. So I'm moving to the compliance requirement rules. And it's going to be the production. I'll edit the rule. And I download the current instructions that I passed to NDI. So let's format this. I don't want to go in deep into this. If you want to take a look at the instruction on how to create these templates, they are into the configuration guidelines. What is important here is the fact that we are investigating all the subnets contained into this specific tenant. And what we are expecting are subnets part of this list. So we have only two lists. If we go back into NDI now and we take a look more in detail at the alert to understand why it's complaining about that, we can see down here that NDI found this subnet, 172.23.0.254, which indeed is not contained into this list. But how was this list generated? Well, by taking information from our IPAM. In this case, I'm using NetBeans. So if I take a look at the tenants I have in NetBox, specifically if I move to the production one and I take a look at the prefixes, you see that we have only two prefixes, 22.3 and 23.1. This is why NDI knows about only those two subnets. So in our case, let's assume that this one is a legitimate subnet and we want to make sure that bridge domains can be configured with it. We can add it to our IPAM. We're going to add the new one. This is going to be the prefix. I'm going to select the production BRF. I'm going to select the tenant as well. Right? So production tenant. And finally, my gateway. I'll save this. And there we go. And now this information is in my IPAM. So imagine that people are constantly adding to your IPAM. You don't want to go in NDI every time and add these rules manually. You don't want to go into this template and change the values. So how do you do? Well. We have APIs, right? It's always the same. So in this case, I will just run the demo wrapper I have here. I don't want to show you the code because it's going to take too much time and there is not much left. I'm going to run the demo for my demo too. And I will explain to you at a high level what is going to happen. So we connect to NDI like we did before. We connect to IPAM via HTTP APIs again. We collect the information from the IPAM. And now let me show you one thing into my Visual Studio code. You see the generated files folder is empty at the moment. The next thing that my script is going to do is going to create those files, right? So if I move back to Visual Studio code, you see that the files now have been generated. So we pull the information from IPAM and we created these templates. The next thing that we are doing, we are pushing these configurations. But we are pushing them only if there is a change. If there are no changes, if NDI is already configured with the right template, we leave it there. In my case, the only one that was updated was the development, right? Because I added the prefix into that one. So I can stop this script. Obviously, at the next execution of the assurance analysis, NDI will validate this rule. It will understand that everything is all right and that will get everything green. The last demo we have today, which is going to be a quick one, it takes, again, this design as an example. There is one design requirement that we should be able to move some bridge domains, some EPGs from the production tenant to the development tenant. So, you know, if we do this manually, it's time consuming. We can generate problems. So what if we create a script to do that? Maybe let's assume that some developer, some smart colleague came up with an idea on how to generate a script in order to do this. But you also want to make sure that the changes are not going to affect your network. You want to make sure that the changes are not going to affect your network. You want to make sure that the changes are not going to impact your network. You want to make sure that the changes are not going to impact your network. How can you do this? Well, you can also integrate here, Nexus dashboard insight pre-change validation with your script. And this is indeed what we are going to do today. So the script takes a look at the APIC. It downloads the configuration from the APIC. It duplicates the configuration over a different tenant. But before pushing the configuration, it asks NDI to perform a pre-change validation. So in my case, even now, I will use the demo version. So in my case, even now, I will use the demo version. So this time it's going to be demo 3. What we are doing now, we connect to the APIC. We get the configuration from the APIC. We generate the new configuration. And indeed, we have a new file here, APIC configuration JSON, which is here, just created, right? And this is simply an ACI configuration, nothing more. Now what we want to do, instead of pushing this, we want to interact with NDI. We want to pass to NDI this configuration. And we want to ask NDI to perform a check and let us know if anything is going to happen. There is one note I want to make here. This operation in NDI might take a few minutes, depending by the fabric, depending by the number of switches, the configuration as well. So here it's probably going to take seven minutes. I don't want to waste your time. So what I did, I actually ran this before, right? Now you see we are at this stage here, submitting PCV job. Before, this was the point, right? So we submitted the job. We let NDI understand what was going on with the configuration. And the result that NDI returned was the following one. NDI found out that if we were going to apply those configurations, we will get a new major anomaly, because we are going to create some unexpected leaking between the VRFs. And as well, we are not going to be compliant with the rules that we defined so far. Why are not going to be compliant? Because remember that the prefix was not added to IPAM as well. So NDI knows this in advance. Okay?
