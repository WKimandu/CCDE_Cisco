# Technical Primer: Nexus as Code for ACI Infrastructure Automation

## Introduction

This technical primer explores Nexus as Code, a solution for implementing Infrastructure as Code (IaC) principles for Cisco ACI environments. It covers fundamental concepts, implementation approaches, and advanced techniques for automating ACI deployments, structured according to Bloom's Taxonomy to facilitate comprehensive learning from basic recall to advanced solution creation.

## 1. Remember: Fundamental Concepts and Terminology

### 1.1 Infrastructure as Code Basics
- Infrastructure as Code (IaC) is a methodology for managing infrastructure through code rather than manual processes
- IaC treats infrastructure configuration as software code that can be versioned, tested, and deployed
- Nexus as Code is Cisco's solution for implementing IaC principles for ACI environments
- Terraform is the underlying technology used by Nexus as Code
- Configuration is maintained as human-readable, machine-parsable text files

### 1.2 Key Components of Nexus as Code
- **Terraform**: The underlying provisioning engine that applies configuration to ACI
- **Terraform Modules**: Pre-built components that abstract complex ACI configurations
- **Configuration Files**: YAML-based description of the desired infrastructure state
- **State Management**: Tracking of applied configuration to detect and reconcile drift
- **Plan and Apply Operations**: Two-step process for reviewing and implementing changes

### 1.3 Benefits of Infrastructure as Code
- **Consistency**: Eliminates configuration drift and ensures consistent deployments
- **Version Control**: Infrastructure configuration can be versioned like application code
- **Automation**: Reduces manual effort and human error
- **Documentation**: Configuration serves as self-documentation of the infrastructure
- **Repeatability**: Enables consistent deployment across multiple environments

### 1.4 Terraform Fundamentals
- **HCL (HashiCorp Configuration Language)**: The language used to write Terraform configurations
- **Terraform Plan**: Dry-run operation that shows what changes would be made
- **Terraform Apply**: Operation that applies the planned changes to the infrastructure
- **Terraform State**: Record of the infrastructure managed by Terraform
- **Terraform Providers**: Plugins that allow Terraform to interact with specific platforms (like ACI)

## 2. Understand: Explaining Concepts and Relationships

### 2.1 Infrastructure as Code Methodology
- IaC shifts infrastructure management from imperative to declarative approach
- Instead of specifying how to configure infrastructure, you declare what the end state should be
- The tooling determines the necessary steps to achieve the desired state
- Changes to infrastructure are made by updating the code, not by direct manipulation
- This creates a predictable, repeatable process for infrastructure changes

### 2.2 Nexus as Code Architecture
- Nexus as Code abstracts the complexity of Terraform and ACI object models
- It provides a simplified YAML-based interface for describing ACI configurations
- The solution translates simple YAML descriptions into complex Terraform configurations
- It organizes configuration logically by function rather than by ACI object hierarchy
- This approach makes it easier to understand and maintain ACI configurations

### 2.3 Terraform Workflow in Nexus as Code
- Configuration starts with YAML files describing the desired infrastructure state
- Nexus as Code translates YAML into Terraform configurations
- Terraform plan operation compares desired state with current state
- Terraform generates a list of changes needed to reach the desired state
- Terraform apply operation implements those changes in the ACI fabric
- State file is updated to reflect the new infrastructure state

### 2.4 Configuration Management Principles
- Infrastructure configuration is treated as a software artifact
- Changes follow software development practices (version control, testing, etc.)
- Configuration is stored in a version control system (like Git)
- Changes are reviewed before being applied to production
- Configuration drift is detected and can be automatically remediated

## 3. Apply: Implementing Nexus as Code

## 4. Analyze: Breaking Down Complex Automation Scenarios

### 4.1 Configuration Organization Patterns
- **Functional Grouping**: Organizing configuration by function rather than object type
- **Environment Separation**: Managing different environments (dev, test, prod) with separate configurations
- **Modular Approach**: Breaking configuration into logical modules for easier management
- **Hierarchical Structure**: Using directory structures to organize complex configurations
- **Template-Based Configuration**: Using templates for repeatable configuration patterns

### 4.2 State Management Strategies
- **Local State**: Managing Terraform state on local filesystem
- **Remote State**: Storing state in remote backends like S3 or Terraform Cloud
- **State Locking**: Preventing concurrent modifications to infrastructure
- **State Backup**: Creating backups of state files before changes
- **State Recovery**: Procedures for recovering from state file corruption or loss

### 4.3 Change Validation Techniques
- **Pre-Change Validation**: Validating configuration before applying changes
- **Syntax Validation**: Ensuring configuration files are properly formatted
- **Semantic Validation**: Verifying that configuration makes logical sense
- **Impact Analysis**: Determining what resources will be affected by changes
- **Rollback Planning**: Preparing for potential failure scenarios

### 4.4 Scaling Considerations
