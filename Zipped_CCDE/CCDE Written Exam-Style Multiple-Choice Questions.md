### Question 1
A global financial services company is implementing a new digital banking platform that will serve customers across three continents. The CIO has emphasized that the network design must support the company's goal of 99.999% availability for customer-facing applications while maintaining regulatory compliance with financial data sovereignty laws in each region. Which of the following design approaches BEST addresses these business requirements?

A. Design a centralized data center architecture with global load balancing and implement caching at regional points of presence
B. Implement a hybrid multi-cloud architecture with regional data processing and storage aligned to sovereignty boundaries
C. Deploy a fully distributed microservices architecture with application components running in each customer's local region
D. Create a primary-backup architecture with synchronous data replication between continental headquarters

**Answer: B**

**Explanation:** This question tests the candidate's ability to evaluate business requirements and translate them into appropriate high-level design decisions. Option B best addresses both the high availability requirement (through multi-cloud redundancy) and the regulatory compliance requirement (through regional data processing and storage that respects data sovereignty laws). Option A doesn't adequately address data sovereignty. Option C is overly complex and likely cost-prohibitive. Option D with synchronous replication across continents would introduce latency issues and may not fully address regional data sovereignty requirements.

### Question 2
A retail company is redesigning its network to support a new business initiative focused on enhancing the in-store customer experience through digital technologies. The business requirements include:
- Supporting real-time inventory visibility across 500 stores

- Minimizing operational costs

Which of the following should be the PRIMARY focus of the high-level network design to meet these business objectives?

A. Implementing a full-mesh MPLS WAN with QoS to ensure real-time application performance
B. Designing a centralized security architecture with next-generation firewalls at the corporate data center
C. Creating a segmented edge computing architecture with local processing capabilities and security controls
D. Deploying SD-WAN with direct internet access at each store to optimize cloud application performance

**Answer: C**

**Explanation:** This question evaluates the candidate's ability to analyze business requirements and prioritize design elements. Option C best addresses the combined requirements: edge computing supports real-time inventory and personalized mobile experiences with low latency, segmentation helps with PCI compliance, and local processing reduces WAN bandwidth needs (controlling costs). Option A focuses only on the WAN without addressing in-store computing needs. Option B is too centralized for the real-time requirements. Option D addresses connectivity but not the local processing and security segmentation needed for the in-store experience and PCI compliance.

## Domain 2: Network Architecture

### Question 3
An enterprise is redesigning its campus network architecture to support increasing IoT deployments, enhanced security requirements, and a hybrid workforce. The current three-tier architecture (access, distribution, core) is showing limitations in scalability and segmentation capabilities. Which architectural approach would BEST address these evolving requirements?

A. Implement a spine-leaf architecture with VXLAN EVPN and microsegmentation throughout the campus
B. Maintain the three-tier architecture but upgrade to higher capacity switches with advanced QoS capabilities
C. Deploy an SD-Access fabric with identity-based policy enforcement and macro-segmentation
D. Convert to a two-tier collapsed core design with enhanced port density and virtualized services

**Answer: C**

**Explanation:** This question tests the candidate's ability to evaluate architectural options against modern enterprise requirements. Option C (SD-Access) provides the best match for the requirements, offering identity-based policy enforcement for security, fabric-based architecture for scalability, and capabilities designed for IoT and hybrid workforce segmentation. Option A (spine-leaf with VXLAN EVPN) is more commonly used in data centers rather than campus environments. Option B doesn't address the fundamental limitations of the architecture for segmentation. Option D reduces hierarchy which could limit scalability for growing IoT deployments.

### Question 4
A healthcare organization is designing a network architecture to support their transition to electronic health records and telemedicine. The design must account for:

C. OSPFv3 with multi-area design and BFD for failure detection
D. IS-IS with wide metric support and IPv4/IPv6 multi-topology

**Answer: C**

**Explanation:** This question tests the ability to evaluate routing protocol selection based on enterprise requirements. Option C (OSPFv3) best meets the requirements because it: supports both IPv4 and IPv6 (critical for future deployment plans); is standards-based for multi-vendor support; provides fast convergence especially when combined with BFD; and offers multi-area capabilities for a structured campus design. Option A (RIPv2) lacks scalability and convergence capabilities for a large campus. Option B (EIGRP) would be challenging in a multi-vendor environment despite its other benefits. Option D (IS-IS) is a viable alternative but typically has a steeper learning curve in enterprise environments compared to OSPF.

### Question 12
An organization is designing the routing architecture for a new data center that will support both traditional applications and modern microservices. The design must accommodate:
- High scalability for server endpoints
- Support for EVPN overlay

A. Traditional OSPF with Type 5 LSAs for external routes
B. BGP EVPN with eBGP for underlay and overlay
C. EIGRP named configurations with route redistribution
D. IS-IS with segment routing and TI-LFA for fast reroute

**Answer: B**

**Explanation:** This question assesses understanding of modern data center routing designs. Option B (BGP EVPN with eBGP) best meets the requirements because: BGP is highly scalable for numerous endpoints; EVPN is explicitly required for the overlay; BGP's policy control supports multitenancy; and using eBGP for both underlay and overlay can simplify operations through consistent protocol usage. Option A lacks native EVPN support. Option C doesn't align with common EVPN implementations. Option D could support some requirements but doesn't directly address the EVPN overlay requirement as effectively as BGP.

## Core Technologies: Network Virtualization

### Question 13

A. Traditional VLANs with 802.1Q trunking and VRF-lite for segmentation
B. VXLAN EVPN with MP-BGP control plane and distributed anycast gateways
C. MPLS L3VPNs with traffic engineering and QoS for predictable performance
D. Overlay Virtual Networks (OVN) with OpenFlow control and service chaining

**Answer: B**

**Explanation:** This question tests understanding of modern network virtualization technologies in multi-cloud contexts. Option B (VXLAN EVPN) provides the most consistent operational model across private and public cloud environments because: VXLAN is widely supported in both enterprise data centers and public cloud environments; EVPN provides a standards-based control plane; distributed anycast gateways optimize traffic flows; and this approach aligns with cloud-provider networking constructs. Option A lacks the scalability and overlay capabilities needed for cloud environments. Option C (MPLS) is less commonly supported in public clouds. Option D is less widely adopted across public cloud providers.

### Question 14
An enterprise is designing a segmentation strategy to support zero-trust principles across their campus and branch locations. Which combination of technologies would provide the MOST effective and scalable approach?

A. Traditional VLANs with port-based 802.1X authentication and stateful firewalls
B. Micro-segmentation with distributed policy enforcement and identity-based access control
C. VRF-lite with zone-based firewalls and IPsec tunnels between segments
D. SDN with centralized controllers and OpenFlow protocol for granular flow control

**Answer: B**

**Explanation:** This question evaluates understanding of modern segmentation approaches. Option B (micro-segmentation with distributed policy enforcement and identity-based access control) best supports zero-trust principles by enabling fine-grained segmentation that follows users and devices regardless of location, with policies based on identity rather than just network location. This approach is also scalable across campus and branch environments. Option A relies too heavily on network location. Option C creates coarse-grained segments that don't fully align with zero-trust principles. Option D focuses on the control mechanism rather than the security model.

## Core Technologies: Security

### Question 15
An organization is designing a comprehensive security architecture for their enterprise network. They need to protect against sophisticated threats while maintaining performance for business applications. Which security design approach would provide the MOST effective protection with minimal impact on legitimate traffic?

B. Implement a defense-in-depth strategy with distributed security controls and threat intelligence integration
C. Create a zero-trust architecture with micro-segmentation and continuous user/device authentication
D. Establish a security operations center with advanced SIEM capabilities and automated incident response

**Answer: B**

**Explanation:** This question tests understanding of enterprise security architecture approaches. Option B (defense-in-depth with distributed controls and threat intelligence) provides the most effective protection while maintaining performance because it: deploys multiple layers of security to prevent single points of failure; distributes controls to avoid performance bottlenecks; and leverages threat intelligence to focus on relevant threats. Option A creates a potential bottleneck and single point of failure. Option C is a valid approach but may impact performance more significantly during initial implementation. Option D focuses on detection and response rather than the architectural approach to protection.

### Question 16
A financial services company is designing a security architecture for their new digital banking platform. Compliance requirements mandate strong protection of customer data, while business requirements emphasize excellent user experience. Which security design approach would BEST balance these requirements?

A. Implement end-to-end encryption for all data with hardware security modules for key management
B. Deploy a risk-based security model with adaptive authentication and context-aware access controls
C. Create network segments with strict inter-segment controls based on regulatory data classifications
D. Establish a centralized security gateway that inspects all traffic entering the banking platform

**Answer: B**

**Explanation:** This question assesses the ability to balance security and user experience requirements. Option B (risk-based security with adaptive authentication) best balances the requirements because it: applies appropriate security controls based on transaction risk; adjusts authentication requirements contextually; and minimizes friction for low-risk activities while increasing protection for high-risk ones. Option A addresses data protection but not the user experience balance. Option C focuses on network-level controls without addressing the authentication experience. Option D could create performance bottlenecks and doesn't specifically address the user experience considerations.

## Core Technologies: Automation

### Question 17
An organization is designing an automation strategy for their network infrastructure. They have a mix of legacy and modern network devices across campus, WAN, and data center environments. Which automation approach would provide the MOST effective path toward comprehensive network automation?

A. Implement script-based automation using Python with device-specific libraries for each platform
B. Deploy a model-driven programmability framework with YANG models and NETCONF/RESTCONF
C. Establish a CI/CD pipeline with infrastructure-as-code templates and automated testing
D. Utilize vendor-specific network controllers with their native automation capabilities

**Answer: B**

**Explanation:** This question tests understanding of network automation approaches. Option B (model-driven programmability with YANG and NETCONF/RESTCONF) provides the most effective path because it: establishes a standards-based approach that works across multiple vendors; provides a consistent operational model despite device differences; enables structured data validation; and works with both modern and legacy devices that support these standards. Option A creates maintenance challenges with device-specific scripts. Option C is valuable but presupposes a specific automation approach. Option D creates potential vendor lock-in and may not work consistently across the mixed environment.

### Question 18
A large enterprise is designing an automation strategy to improve network change management. Their goals include reducing human error, improving compliance, and accelerating service delivery. Which approach would BEST achieve these objectives?

A. Implement a traditional change advisory board process with detailed documentation requirements
B. Deploy network configuration management tools that provide compliance checking and backup
C. Establish an intent-based networking system with automated validation and closed-loop verification
D. Create a network-as-code approach with version control, CI/CD pipeline, and automated testing

**Answer: D**

**Explanation:** This question evaluates understanding of modern network change management approaches. Option D (network-as-code with CI/CD) best achieves the objectives because it: reduces human error through automation and testing; improves compliance through version control and consistent deployments; and accelerates service delivery through pipeline automation. Option A relies on manual processes that don't address the goals. Option B improves compliance but doesn't significantly accelerate delivery. Option C is powerful but may require a more substantial architectural change than a network-as-code approach, which can be implemented incrementally.

## Core Technologies: Wireless

### Question 19
An enterprise is designing a wireless network to support high-density environments including conference centers and open office spaces. Which combination of design approaches would MOST effectively support these high-density requirements?

A. Deploy 802.11ac Wave 2 APs with maximum transmit power and minimal channel overlap
B. Implement 802.11ax (Wi-Fi 6/6E) with BSS coloring, OFDMA, and carefully planned cell sizes
C. Utilize directional antennas with 802.11ac and dynamic channel assignment algorithms
D. Install a distributed antenna system with centralized 802.11ac controllers for seamless roaming

**Answer: B**

**Explanation:** This question tests understanding of modern wireless design for high-density environments. Option B (Wi-Fi 6/6E with its specific features) provides the most effective approach because: 802.11ax introduces multiple technologies specifically designed for high-density environments; BSS coloring reduces co-channel interference; OFDMA enables more efficient use of spectrum with multiple clients; and proper cell sizing ensures appropriate coverage without excessive co-channel interference. Option A's maximum power approach would increase interference. Option C lacks the efficiency benefits of 802.11ax. Option D (DAS) is typically more appropriate for coverage challenges rather than density challenges.

### Question 20
