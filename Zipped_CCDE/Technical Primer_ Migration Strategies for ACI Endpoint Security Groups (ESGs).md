# Technical Primer: Migration Strategies for ACI Endpoint Security Groups (ESGs)

## Introduction

This technical primer explores migration strategies from traditional Endpoint Groups (EPGs) to Endpoint Security Groups (ESGs) in Cisco ACI environments. It covers fundamental concepts, implementation approaches, and advanced techniques for successful migration, structured according to Bloom's Taxonomy to facilitate comprehensive learning from basic recall to advanced solution creation.

## 1. Remember: Fundamental Concepts and Terminology

### 1.1 ESG Migration Basics
- ESG migration involves transitioning from network-centric EPG models to security-centric ESG models
- ACI 5.2+ is recommended as the minimum version for ESG implementation
- Migration involves decoupling networking (EPGs) from security (ESGs)
- EPGs remain for network provisioning while ESGs handle security policy
- Route leaking is simplified and moved to the VRF level with ESGs

### 1.2 Key ESG Selector Types
- **IP Subnet Selector**: Classifies endpoints based on IP address or subnet
- **Tag Selector**: Classifies endpoints based on policy tags attached to endpoints
- **EPG Selector**: Maps all endpoints in an EPG to an ESG (introduced in ACI 5.2)
- **Service EPG Selector**: Specific for service graph and PBR use cases
- **VM Name Selector**: Classifies endpoints based on VM name patterns

### 1.3 Migration Considerations
- Hardware requirements (4th generation or newer leaf switches)
- Software requirements (ACI 5.2+ recommended)
- Layer 2 traffic handling requirements
- Contract conversion planning
- Route leaking reconfiguration
- Testing and validation methodology

### 1.4 ESG Benefits in Migration Context
- Decoupling of networking and security
- Simplified security policy configuration
- Reduced TCAM resource utilization
- More flexible security grouping across bridge domains
- Simplified inter-VRF route leaking
- More predictable policy deployment

## 2. Understand: Explaining Concepts and Relationships

### 2.1 ESG Migration Principles
- **Phased Approach**: Migration typically occurs in stages rather than all at once
- **Parallel Operation**: EPGs and ESGs can operate simultaneously during migration
- **Security Equivalence**: Ensuring security policies remain equivalent during transition
- **Incremental Testing**: Validating each migration step before proceeding
- **Rollback Planning**: Maintaining ability to revert to EPG-based security if needed

### 2.2 ESG Selector Mechanics
- **IP Subnet Selector**: Requires routed (L3) traffic for classification
- **Tag Selector**: Two-step process - attach tags to endpoints, then configure selectors
- **EPG Selector**: Automatically maps all endpoints in an EPG to an ESG
- **Selector Precedence**: Rules determine which selector takes precedence when multiple match
- **Selector Combination**: Multiple selectors within an ESG are combined with OR logic

### 2.3 Layer 2 Traffic Handling with ESGs
- ESG classification requires inspection of IP headers
- Layer 2 traffic doesn't have IP headers inspected by default
- Solutions include enabling micro-segmentation or EPG isolation
- Alternatively, using EPG selectors avoids this issue entirely
- Understanding when this limitation impacts migration planning

### 2.4 Route Leaking Transformation
- Traditional EPG approach uses shared subnets and contracts for route leaking
- ESG approach uses explicit route leaking configuration at VRF level
- No dependency on contract relationships for route leaking
- More intuitive and straightforward configuration
- Clearer separation of routing and security concerns

## 3. Apply: Implementing ESG Migration

### 3.1 Migration Preparation Steps
```
1. Verify ACI version (5.2+ recommended)
2. Verify hardware compatibility (4th gen+ leaf switches)
3. Document existing EPG-based security policies
4. Identify bridge domains and VRFs in scope
5. Plan ESG structure and naming convention
6. Create migration schedule and testing plan
7. Prepare rollback procedures
```

### 3.2 Creating ESGs with EPG Selectors (Initial Migration)
```
Tenant > Application Profiles > Endpoint Security Groups
- Name: Web-ESG
- Description: Web servers security zone

Under Web-ESG > Selectors
- Name: Web-EPG-Selector
- Type: EPG
- Application Profile: MyApp
- EPG: Web-EPG
```

### 3.3 Converting EPG Contracts to ESG Contracts
```
1. Document existing contracts between EPGs
2. Create equivalent contracts for ESGs
3. Apply contracts to ESGs (provided/consumed)
4. Verify contract application
5. Remove contracts from EPGs
6. Test communication between endpoints
```

### 3.4 Configuring Inter-VRF Route Leaking with ESGs
```
Tenant > Networking > Inter-VRF Leaked Routes
- VRF: VRF-1
- BD Subnets to Leak:
  - BD: BD-1
  - Subnet: 10.1.1.0/24
  - Leak to VRFs: VRF-2
  - Advertise Externally: No

- VRF: VRF-2
- External Prefixes to Leak:
  - Prefix: 0.0.0.0/0
  - Leak to VRFs: VRF-1
```
