# TODO - CCDE Bloom's Taxonomy Framework Implementation

This task involves applying Bloom's Taxonomy across the comprehensive set of CCDE exam materials provided by the user. The goal is to create a structured learning experience by defining objectives, assessments, and content organization aligned with different cognitive levels.

## Phase 1: Initial Review and Framework Development

*   [X] **Step 1: Review CCDE Exam Materials and Requirements (Current)**
    *   [X] Systematically review all newly uploaded CCDE exam topic lists, technology lists, study guides, and release notes.
    *   [X] Identify the main subject areas and domains covered by the CCDE certification.
    *   [X] Extract key learning requirements and expected competencies for each domain.
    *   [X] Create a catalog or summary of the reviewed documents and their relevance.
*   [X] **Step 2: Analyze Cognitive Levels Needed for Each Subject Area**
    *   [X] For each identified CCDE subject area, determine the appropriate Bloom's Taxonomy levels that candidates need to achieve (Remember, Understand, Apply, Analyze, Evaluate, Create).
    *   [X] Map exam objectives from the official documents to these cognitive levels.
*   [X] **Step 3: Develop Comprehensive Bloom's Taxonomy Framework for CCDE**
    *   [X] Design a standardized framework for applying Bloom's Taxonomy across all CCDE subjects.
    *   [X] This framework should include guidelines for writing learning objectives, creating assessment items, and tagging content for each Bloom's level.
*   [X] **Step 4: Create Subject-Specific Learning Objectives Template**
    *   [X] Develop a template that can be used to generate consistent, measurable learning objectives for various topics within each CCDE subject area, aligned with the framework.

## Phase 2: Implementation and Validation
*   [X] **Step 5: Implement Framework for Priority Subject Areas**
    *   [X] Based on user input or exam weighting, select initial priority subject areas for implementation.
    *   [X] Apply the framework and templates to develop Bloom\'s-aligned learning objectives for these priority areas.
    *   [X] Integrate these objectives into existing or new study materials for these areas.
*   [X] **Step 6: Develop Assessment Bank Aligned with Exam Requirements**
    *   [X] Create a bank of sample assessment questions (MCQs, scenarios, design challenges) for the priority subject areas.
    *   [X] Ensure questions are mapped to specific learning objectives and Bloom's levels, and reflect the style and complexity of CCDE exam questions.
*   [X] **Step 7: Integrate and Validate with User Feedback**
    *   [X] Share the developed materials (objectives, sample assessments) for priority areas with the user for review and feedback.
    *   [X] Iterate on the materials based on feedback.

## Phase 3: Finalization and Delivery

*   [X] **Step 8: Finalize and Deliver Comprehensive Bloom\'s Taxonomy Implementation**    *   [ ] Refine all developed materials based on validation and feedback.
    *   [ ] Organize all deliverables (framework document, templates, objectives lists, assessment bank) for user access.
    *   [ ] Provide a final report summarizing the work done and guidance on how to use and extend the framework.
